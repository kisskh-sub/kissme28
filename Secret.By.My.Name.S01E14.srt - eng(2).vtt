00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.218
After a review of the accounts,

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.179
Tan Jianfei's

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.420
projects were found
to have financial irregularities.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.550
They have already affected
the normal operations of the Overseas Division.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.139
Therefore, starting this month,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.018
all of his duties will be suspended.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.180
Ms. Zhao, is this personal retaliation?

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.099
Yes.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.059
I want to see whether Mr. Tan,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.419
when it comes to finances,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.299
is as tough in practice

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.140
as he is in words.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.500
If you have any objections,

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.099
you may file an appeal

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.339
with the Overseas Division.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.298
Then Ms. Zhao,

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.740
don't blame me
if I strike without restraint.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:03.299

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.100
Flowers.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.259
Flowers smell nice.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.939
Jing likes them.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.340
Jing likes them.

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:14.338
One, two.

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:15.019
That's right.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.258
Shujing likes flowers,

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.058
good food,

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:18.060
and dyes.

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:19.700
Who are you?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.099
How do you know

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.340
about Jing?

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.659
Jing.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.939
Jing is amazing.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.980
She is...

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:31.579
She is...

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.899
The Design Director.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.939
Drawing.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.019
Drawing.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.459
Ms. Li's designs
truly are one of a kind.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.019
Mom, I'm here.

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:47.860
She's really impressive.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.459
Flowers.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.978
Come, Mom.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:55.900
Give them to me.

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:58.099
I'll put them away for you.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.819
Mom.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.299
I'm no longer the Design Director now.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.739
I've been reassigned to the factory.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.019
The factory?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.980
The factory...

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.579
You can't go back to the factory.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.138
No.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.379
Mom.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.899
- Mom.
- You can't go back.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.139
It's okay.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.019
The factory isn't like it used to be.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.340
Nothing will happen again.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.818
Mom, don't worry.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.859
I'm here.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.460
Nothing will happen.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.500
Alright?

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.579
I bought your
favorite canned tangerines.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.259
I'll open it for you, okay?

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.620
Here.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.939
How have things been
at the factory lately?

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.379
Has anyone been giving you trouble?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.580
Who told you to come here?

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.538
Mr. Tan, with your money and influence,
even without being immediate family,

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:42.979
no one dares stop you, right?

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.299
Here, open up.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.200
I was worried you've been
too busy at the factory,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.259
that no one came to see Auntie. So I...

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.580
Why did my mom end up like this,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.780
and why was I forced back
to the factory,

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.139
you should know better than anyone else.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.819
So what are you pretending to be now?

00:02:58.499 --> 00:02:59.340
Shujing.

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.220
Do you really have to
talk to me like this?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.139
Here.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.139
Is it good?

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.500
We're all caught in the same whirlpool,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.099
none of us truly free.

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:18.627
So?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.280
Just because we're in the whirlpool,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.080
does that mean we
can't choose where we stand?

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.640
Wasn't Mr. Tan already
choosing the family long ago,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.938
just to protect himself?

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.900
Shujing.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.859
Give me a little more time.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.379
Trust me.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.979
My arrow of judgment
is in your hands alone.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.580
You can aim it at my heart
whenever you wish.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.899
Can you stop saying

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.220
such disgusting things?

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.900
Mr. Tan, please leave.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.739
My mother

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.139
and my career are none of your concern.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.659
Get out right now.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:47.658
In front of Auntie,

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:48.979
don't get so worked up.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.500
She can't handle outside stimulation.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.780
Shujing.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.979
He...

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.299
He's good.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.259
Not bad.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.500
Not bad.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.379
Whatever you say is fine.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.819
Auntie, don't worry.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.819
I'll stay with you and Shujing.

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.499
Master Zhao.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.379
You're almost at retirement age.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.979
Don't do this kind
of heavy work anymore.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.859
Let the younger ones handle it.

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.780
I'm old and worn out now.

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:30.978
Seeing you

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.218
reminds me of

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:33.900
how your father used to
lead me back then.

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:35.259
In those days,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.179
we were strong as oxen.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.340
But in the blink of an eye,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.380
we've all grown old.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.059
Your father, he...

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.619
Master Zhao.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.098
If my dad knew that you were the one
guiding me at the factory,

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.619
he'd be so happy.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.179
He'd definitely tell me
to learn properly from you.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.579
My skills

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.940
can't keep up anymore.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.298
Back in the day,

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.140
I once mentored a promising kid.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.658
That young girl worked incredibly hard,

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.979
and she loved learning too.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.738
In those years,
all the factory spot checks

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.499
were handled by her alone.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.778
Because she was
a core member of the factory,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.640
she was later transferred
to the Overseas Division.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.619
You mean...

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.658
You don't know?

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.340
It was Zhao Rou.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.179
Back then, your father
valued her the most.

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:25.940
Zhao Rou...

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.899
Mr. Tan,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.140
are you still unwilling
to cooperate with me?

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.979
You keep treating me so coldly.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.179
That really

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.380
hurts, you know.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.539
I've already been sidelined.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.098
If Ms. Zhao still wants to play

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.900
the workplace harassment angle with me,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.619
that's fine by me.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.539
You can call people
over to watch right now.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.978
Such a ruthless heart, little brother.

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.099
What ill intent
could your sister possibly have?

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.899
I only want, together with you,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.298
to make Tan Group

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:03.658
bigger and stronger.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.098
Could it be that in your heart,

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.418
there's only that woman,

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.499
and no place for money or power?

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:11.299
Get to the point.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.260
If you choose me,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.019
I'll put all Overseas Division projects

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.338
fully behind you.

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.340
But if you keep holding out,

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:21.739
it won't stop with you.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.059
Even that woman,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.059
I won't spare.

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.979
I despise being threatened.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.340
If you dare lay a hand on her,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.380
you'd better be ready to pay the price.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.659
Refusing the toast
and choosing punishment instead.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.978
You really make me
torn between love and hate.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.000
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.419
I almost can't bring myself to let go.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:57.939
Hasn't anyone told Ms. Zhao

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.178
that a man's tie and belt

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:00.659
are not to be touched lightly?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.419
If you touch them again,

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:04.099
you'll lose a hand.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.099
Before Ms. Zhao interferes
with my project funds,

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.979
you'd better clean up
your own accounts first.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940
Who says my projects have problems?

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.059
(So there really is an issue.)

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.979
Zhao Rou's record
looks spotless on paper.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.800
(Personal Resume Zhao Rou)
The Overseas Division's fund breakdowns

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.260
have all been reviewed by her own team.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.960
For now,
there's no obvious hole to point to.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.699
They're all

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.178
legitimate fund movements.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:38.140
But...

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:40.659
But what?

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:43.900
Zhao Rou already has a VIE account
in the Cayman Islands.

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:46.418
The scale of funds in it
is far beyond what her project team

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.218
could accumulate on salaries alone.

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:49.979
They must have other businesses.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:54.858
Send Zhao Rou's overseas records

00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:55.858
and this photo

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:56.940
to Li Shujing.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.699
I'm starting to suspect

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.380
that Zhao Rou's cash flow
ran into trouble,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.720
and that's why she rushed back
to the country to plug the hole.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.019
Keep digging as well into Zhao Rou's
domestic transactions back then,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.979
especially those tied
to Chuangyang Factory.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.979
But,

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:11.820
if she catches on...

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:15.338
Fight fire with fire,

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:17.020
and turn her own methods back on her.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.099
It'll be her turn to lose her footing.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.419
(The water
is getting murkier by the minute.)

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.780
(It's time to bring the truth)

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.979
(from back then into the open.)

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.899
I followed Zhao Rou in secret.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.259
She's been in frequent contact
with Chuangyang Factory's former head.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.779
Right now, she definitely doesn't want you
staying at the factory.

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.499
You're a ticking time bomb to her,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.259
one that could blow her up
at any moment.

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:05.938
So

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:07.139
we need to uncover

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.700
what she actually did back then.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.538
This photo was sent to my email

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:13.899
by Tan Jianfei's secretary,

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:15.899
since I blocked him.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.139
How has he been lately?

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:22.099
What,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.058
you're worried about him?

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.379
Who's worried about him?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.540
Lately,

00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:27.832
he's been having a hard time.

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:29.820
He's being targeted?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.178
He's been...

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:33.979
Forget it.

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:36.060
What does he have to do with me?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.060
By the way,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.658
there's one more thing.

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:45.320
I found that a recent batch
of fabric at the factory

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.340
has issues.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:43.418
Ms. Li,

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.580
so you finally took me
off your blacklist.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.640
You know I've been
having a rough time lately,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.920
so if you wanted to see me, just say so.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.420
Why pick a place like this?

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.180
Whether you're having a hard time
has nothing to do with me.

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:57.460
I asked you here

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.999
so you could see for yourself

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.911
how Tan Group's legacy

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:02.512
was squandered piece by piece.

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:19.982
(Qiantong Ancient Town Shadow Puppetry)

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.300
Why so stiff?

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:30.957
Are you afraid of me, or the dark?

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.859
Zhao Rou is laundering money
through Chuangyang Factory, right?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.379
There must be someone else
backing Zhao Rou.

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:09.619
That's why

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.379
only if we work together

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:12.859
do we stand a chance of winning.

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:15.899
I'll cooperate,

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:17.779
but that doesn't mean I forgive you.

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:19.660
Deal.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.739
My accomplice.

00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:32.300
Childish.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.379
Tan Jianfei is digging
into your overseas accounts.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.580
Move faster.

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:19.580
Burn Warehouse Three.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.379
Leave nothing behind.
