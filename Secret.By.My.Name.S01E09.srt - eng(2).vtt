I'll spare your life.

Not just yours.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:29.739
Every single member of the Tan family

There's nothing to think about.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.659

Rushing over there like this,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.320
aren't you afraid Wang Jinkai
will drag everyone down with him?

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:34.580
Why are you here?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.939
Of course I'm here to help

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.780

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.940
So what's your plan?

Before coming here,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.619
I looked closely into

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.380
Wang Jinkai's family background.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.700
My plan

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:49.499
is to take a gamble.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.619

a trace of humanity left.

Do you really think

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.979
you deserve everything you have now?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.859
Relying on that face of yours

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.900
to lure the Tan brothers?

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:39.900
Let me tell you this.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:41.218
Without that face,

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:42.780
you are nothing.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.778
You think ruining my face

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.260
would make me afraid of you?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.059
Fine.

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:51.380
Beg me.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.340
Beg me the way your father did,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.900
kneeling back then.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.059
Believe it or not, I might show mercy

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.299
and leave you half that face.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.580
So you can cry at your mother's grave.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.218
Then you'd better take my tongue too.

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:12.260
Otherwise, every disgusting thing
you've done

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.579
I will tell your daughter,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.419
word for word, in the future.

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:17.739
You…

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:23.697
You're the one who should be begging.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.379
Fine.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.978
Then I'll grant your wish.

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.298
I'll send you off together,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.700

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.140

00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:42.658

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.739
You want your daughter

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.099

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:46.298
Wang Jinkai.

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:47.899
If you stop right now,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.300
I'll have the Tan Group

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.259
drop several charges against you.

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.580
At worst, you serve a couple of years.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.578
But if you keep going like this,

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:58.700
there will be no way back.

that will haunt her

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.180

Daddy's playing
a game of saving the princess.
