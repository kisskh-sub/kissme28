WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.360
Who exactly is this ghost.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.840
That one, Dao. Your mother, Thup.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.280
Then who is my father.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.880
Name’s Atikun.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.280
- Is this the cold room.
- Uh, yeah.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.520
Why build a cold room here.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.880
Mr. Monthat Bunkingklai has died in custody.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.160
You won’t be on this job much longer.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.320
- What happened.
- They pulled me off the case.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.440
You done yet. What should we eat.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.720
Sorry, Song.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.240
You know the killer wasn’t alone.
We could match your DNA.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.000
Thup’s DNA matches Bom’s.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.960
Or maybe they’re siblings.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.720
If Mek had been removed from the team,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.400
we wouldn’t have this information.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.600
Before the name Santi Hinniyom,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.120
it was Anuphap Bunprim.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.240
Both first and last names
were changed at fifteen.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.720
Same surname as

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.440
Atikun.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.240
And the DNA matches you too.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.400
Those two are likely father and son.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.720
And you’re likely siblings with him too.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.600
But we still have to keep digging.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.080
Atikun…

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.000
Is he really dead,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.520
or hiding somewhere.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.280
But if it’s like what I’m thinking,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.640
he probably changed his name
and started a new life,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800
in another province,
and kept committing crimes many more times.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.680
I really want to know.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.280
How the hell did he evade the police.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Then…

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.920
Can you ask Captain Mek
to check Atikun’s current name.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.200
Already tried.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.920
But found nothing at all.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.160
It’s like someone who

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.800
is really dead.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.240
Bom can still be tracked,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800
but Atikun…

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.480
there’s nothing at all.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.520
If you can catch Bom,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.600
finding Atikun shouldn’t be that hard,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.320
if he’s still alive.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.920
At the very least,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.200
they should still be
contacting each other by phone.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.720
Then try checking,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400
Bom’s YouTube.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.000
Find anything.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120
Nothing unusual at all.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.079
But from what I’ve seen,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.120
he’s gone ghost-hunting
and challenging spirits in many areas.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.800
I think…

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560
Bom likely used this method

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.720
to find locations suitable for his rituals.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.720
I didn’t do anything.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.440
Don’t move.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.840
I said stop.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.440
Back then, when I found that broken doll,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.720
I might have interfered with Bom’s ritual.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.880
So a new killing began.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.520
It was already Sunday.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.840
Hey, what are you doing.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.200
Hey, I’m filming a clip.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.920
Damn it.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.720
His ritual was interrupted.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.720
So he had to kill someone born on Sunday again.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Om.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.920
Mother, bought to worship
the Black House Mother.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.000
The Golden House Mother, buried,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.279
lying sealed within an earthen effigy.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.800
I invoke Wichitramawanna.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.000
Rise. Look forth.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.120
Breathe your will into this house.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.680
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.440
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.920
If you hadn’t found those dolls,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.520
I wouldn’t have gotten this close to them.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920
But I still feel guilty anyway.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.120
Stop obsessing over Atikun.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.080
Finish this case quickly,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.400
and leave all that behind.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.000
But I don’t want others to bully you.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.560
You’re a cop.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.720
How can you love a killer’s child.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280
Who said that.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840
Huh.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.400
I’ll punch his damn mouth.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.880
I’m protecting your career as a police officer.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.720
Can you stop talking now.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840
Why.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.920
If I don’t stop,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.200
are you going to kiss me again.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.200
Then I’ll just keep talking.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.600
Seeing you tease like this again,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.160
I feel more at ease.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.080
If you don’t mind,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.440
then I’m okay.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.400
What about Bom.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.040
No movement at all yet.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.680
The car is still parked in the same spot.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.280
But I’ve ordered the entrances and exits sealed.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.080
We’re waiting for the spare key from management.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360
Sing.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.560
Why did you suddenly get interested in Bom.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.520
I thought Thup might be connected to Atikun somehow.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.680
So I asked him to run a DNA test.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000
In case it matched someone in our database.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.280
But it matched Bom instead.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.680
Wait.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.600
Since I came back to Bangkok earlier,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240
what happened in Sisaket.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920
Atikun

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.440
is my father.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.000
And he’s Bom’s father too.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.400
What.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.000
What the hell.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.919
Does that mean Thup and Bom are brothers.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.120
What kind of madness is this.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.440
Management says the spare key is ready now.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.800
- Let’s go. Hurry.
- This way.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.000
Looks like worship of Mae Sue.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.320
But changed from worship to a curse.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.000
Changed from white to black.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.920
Normally,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.000
villagers worship Mae Sue

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.520
to protect newborn babies.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.440
But some people misuse it like this.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.840
That’s seriously messed up.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.600
Send it for testing too.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.600
- See if it matches the clay.
- Yes.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.000
P’Sing, come take a look at this.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.800
This calendar has Song’s name written on it too.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.920
It matches Sunday.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.520
Song?

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.080
The kid in Bom’s gang.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.120
Yes.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.320
Try contacting him.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.200
If Song was really born on Sunday,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.720
Bom probably dragged him off
for the ritual already.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.120
Then who’s the next victim.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680
Who is it.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.840
The ritual has to follow
the days in order, right.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.680
So if Song was born on Sunday,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.720
the next one has to be Monday.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.760
Bom Santi

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.000
Jump Thitiphon

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.680
Song Songsin

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.920
Dear Rotsorn

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.280
I think this name was born on Monday.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.040
How do you know.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.720
People born on Monday

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.400
can’t have vowels in their names.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.920
It’s considered inauspicious.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.880
Dear.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.480
Born on the 25th, month 11, 2002.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.320
25th of November, 2002.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.840
Damn, Dear was really born on Monday.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.280
Then the next victim

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.280
has to be this one.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.040
Shit.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.400
This place is creepy as hell.
Customers would love it.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.600
Hey…

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.520
If Song still hasn’t shown up,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.120
maybe… maybe we should go back.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160
Hey…

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.600
Let’s go back.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.400
Go back my ass. We’re already here.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.400
This room’s perfect. Great content.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.760
Look.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.800
Damn, it looks so real.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.920
What was that sound.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.600
I think it’s that room.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.520
Let’s go back.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.120
Did you hear something.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.720
Hey, hey, just go back.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.440
Wait. We’re already this far.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
Jump.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160
Jump.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.360
Jump.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.520
Jump, wake up.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480
Bom.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.840
Bom.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.040
Monday is done.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.240
Tuesday is done too.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.400
What’s wrong with you.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.600
You haven’t talked to me since earlier.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040
Or…

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.200
Seriously.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.200
Are you still annoyed with me about

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.720
me doing those ritual cleansings.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.320
If that’s the case,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.520
would you want me to stop for you.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360
Oh.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.120
Probably not.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.520
The reason I do those rituals

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.280
is because Master Aisoon once warned me

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.400
that if I didn’t,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.640
people close to me could get caught in it too.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.280
And the reason I took holy water baths

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.320
- Being soaked like a stray dog is because…
- Because of superstition.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.680
I just don’t want that person to be you, Sey.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.400
Just thinking that something happened to you,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.000
my heart nearly shattered.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.200
If you had told me beforehand,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.720
I wouldn’t have gotten angry.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.320
If I told you, we’d end up fighting.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.920
I don’t want us to fight like before anymore.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.600
Every time we disagreed,
everything fell apart.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.040
I don’t want that.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.920
But if we don’t talk honestly,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.600
it’ll just turn into an undercurrent later.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.680
And I’m not okay with that either.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.120
But from now on,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.040
I’ll adjust.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.200
But…

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.240
if you’re going to do
something like this again,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.720
just tell me first.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.480
Okay.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.319
This is…

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.000
the protective charm I told you to carry, right.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.839
You actually kept it with you.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.920
I carry it all the time.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.760
So you believe in this stuff now.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560
No.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.920
I don’t really believe in this stuff.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.520
But I believe in you.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.160
If you tell me to carry it,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.960
then I will.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.080
Because I want to be with you forever.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.400
I’ve chosen already.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.080
What is this.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.520
Suddenly getting all sweet.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.200
I don’t know how to react now.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.920
I can be sweeter than this.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680
Wait.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.000
You’re not supposed to wear a Palad Khik
when doing it.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.400
This is my old room.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.120
For now, use it as a safe house
while you’re suspended.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.880
Make yourself at home.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.840
About how many hours.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080
Yes.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.720
Alright. Thank you very much.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760
Everyone.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.000
I’ve contacted Dear’s parents.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.920
They said Dear left home since the afternoon.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.360
His phone is off. They can’t reach him.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.400
I’ll try requesting additional CCTV footage
from private sources.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.200
What about the other kids in the gang.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.680
Jump.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.640
Can’t contact him.
Looks like the whole gang vanished.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.520
I think this is a really bad sign.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.560
Hungry.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.040
It’s okay, P’.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.200
I don’t really feel like eating anyway.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.440
I’m basically skin and bones already.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.120
Don’t you usually fuss about food.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.320
Come on. I’ll take you to eat.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.400
Come on.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.720
Have you heard anything about P'Sing.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.000
Not yet.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.720
Hey…

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.000
I think we should go see P'Sing.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.600
So we can tell him about Santi Tham House.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.400
Then we can keep working, right.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.320
Right now, our heads are already half
on the chopping block.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.120
Big Pong won’t like it for sure.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.800
If he finds out the medical examiner

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.040
nudged the police to reopen the case.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.400
Screw it.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.080
We’re doing the right thing.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.520
If we get fired, so be it.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.520
As long as you’ve got me.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.480
That’s badass.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.240
Because our heads will roll together.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.920
Sey.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.000
Who taught you to say things like bad omens.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.320
Just kidding.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.880
Can I come closer.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.320
Another round.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.400
Excuse me.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.200
Could you please sign these documents, doctor.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.080
Of course.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.000
Got a headache.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760
A little.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.320
You’ve got a fever.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.000
Should you rest a bit.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.440
You haven’t rested since
getting back from Sisaket.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.360
Victims can’t wait.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.720
How can the police rest.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.920
But…

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240
But what.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.400
But you’re older now.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.320
I’m saying this because I care.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.720
If you don’t rest,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.320
you’ll get sick.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.840
Don’t you love someone once they’re older.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.080
When I get older,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.600
will you love me less.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.920
Well.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.800
So, do you love me or not.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.000
Of course I love you.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.320
No matter how old you get, I’ll still love you.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.520
Then no need to rest anymore.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.200
Just hearing that

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.800
already cured me.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.800
What, haven’t you heard

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.280
when they say

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.560
love

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.400
makes people stronger.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.280
Sweet stuff like this doesn’t suit P'Singha.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.400
It just doesn’t fit.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.120
You’ve got the nerve to tease me now.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.720
You don’t have to be that sweet.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.320
I’m getting all grossed out. About to puke.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.000
Teasing, huh.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.560
Come in.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.120
These images were taken
from Santi Tham House.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.560
This room is in the inner zone
on the second floor.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.920
It was tightly locked.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.920
You guys think there’s something
in the cold room, right.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640
A body.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960
Or a victim.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.320
They might still be frozen inside.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.520
A cold room helps preserve the body.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.080
From the victims you’ve examined,

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.800
is this kind of storage method possible.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.120
If the room temperature is below 5 degrees,

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.680
and the victim’s clothing is thick enough,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.480
if the killer forces the victim
into a curled position,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.800
the brain slows down,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.760
the body enters hypothermia.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.680
The organs gradually shut down,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.120
and death occurs naturally.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.320
And how long does that take.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.200
Several hours.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.320
So if the killer used this method
and the victim isn’t dead yet,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.720
we still have a chance
to get there in time.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.600
Found the car.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.280
Jump’s car turned off the main road
toward the southern route.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.040
- Send people.
- Yes.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.080
Sing.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.720
Did you forget.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.400
We’ve been pulled off this case.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.400
What authority do you have to give orders.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.000
I’ll track Jump myself.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.200
Then Santi Tham House,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.960
I’ll handle that part myself.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440
You.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.120
this is Jump’s car.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.360
Mek.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480
Follow me in.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.720
Should we split up and search.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.880
No. It’s dangerous right now.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.520
But it increases the chance
of finding the victim.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.200
We’re racing against time.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.320
Mek, go get the warrant.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.120
Dad, please sign this for me.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.080
I told you already. No means no.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.160
But we have this much
credible information already.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.320
Are you going to let the criminal walk free.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.040
The case is closed.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.920
I remember transferring you
to Central Investigation already, didn’t I.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.800
Because it’s really not over yet.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.960
I’m asking for just one signature.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.720
Let me search Santi Tham House.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.280
To see what’s really inside.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.040
Stop working on this damn case already.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.000
I swallowed my pride

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.960
and sent you back to Central Investigation

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
to preserve what little
police honor you have left.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.720
But you

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.400
keep trying to play the righteous cop
in some morality drama with your friends.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.600
I’m just here to inform you

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.000
that I’m going to search Santi Tham House.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.240
And if you don’t sign the approval,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.600
then be careful what I might start talking about,
the things you’ve been covering up.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.480
I’m your father.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.720
How dare you talk to me like that.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.240
Send people to Santi Tham House now.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560
King.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.120
As for the warrant,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680
I’ll follow up.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.680
Who do you think you are.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760
King.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.920
Get back here right now.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.880
You ungrateful bastard.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240
Thup.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
Thup.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.200
Mek.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.720
(Chanting)

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.400
(Chanting)

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.120
(Chanting)

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.200
(Chanting)

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.560
(Chanting)

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.280
(Chanting)

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.280
(Chanting)

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.440
(Chanting)

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.040
Follow me.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.120
We have to find out.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.480
Where the key to that suspicious room is.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.720
And where are you going to get it.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160
Hey.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.480
Master Aisoon. Master Aisoon.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.400
What’s wrong, Master Aisoon.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.840
Call a doctor.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.600
Something’s wrong with Master Aisoon.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.560
Yes.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.320
We’re doctors.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.960
- This way.
- Excuse us.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.000
Excuse me.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.720
The patient can’t breathe.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.560
- Some water, please.
- Yes.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.680
Try to stay calm.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.800
Darin, hold his arm.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.280
Excuse me.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.800
Spit it out.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.320
Okay.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360
Relax.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.400
Take a deep breath.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.320
P'Singha.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.800
P'Singha.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.920
Can you hear me, P'Singha.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.280
P'Singha.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.240
Answer me.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560
Thup.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.680
P'Singha isn’t responding.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.120
The radio doesn’t seem to work.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.000
P'Sing, can you hear me.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.520
If you hear me, please answer.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.760
P'Sing. You,

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.040
Thup, let me see the radio.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.199
P'Sing. P'Sing.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.800
The signal’s probably bad.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.520
P'Sing will probably come back.
Let’s wait here.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.000
What is that.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.639
That’s a talisman from Santi Tham House.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.720
P'Singha.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280
Mesa.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.480
Mesa.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.520
Why.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.800
Why didn’t you believe me.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.120
Why.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.400
I believe you.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.240
I believe you now.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.200
If you had believed me,
I wouldn’t be dead.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.480
I,

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.520
I’m sorry.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.640
Mesa, I’m sorry.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.440
Please forgive me.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.320
Don’t be mad at me.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.040
Come back home with Mom and me.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.760
Mesa, where are you going.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.520
I’m not well. We’re almost home already.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.880
- Why are you saying such crazy things.
- Mom’s the crazy one.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.760
Why didn’t you believe me.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.160
I told you to come live together.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.320
Wait here for me first, okay.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.880
In case someone comes back.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.440
Thup. Thup. Thup.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.320
Damn it.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.720
P'Singha.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.720
P'Singha.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.280
P'Singha.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.680
P'Singha.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.120
P'Singha.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.880
P'Singha. It’s me, Thup.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.440
P'Singha.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.520
P'Singha. It’s me, Thup.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.720
P'Singha.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.880
P'Singha.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.640
P'Singha.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.320
Thup. Thup.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480
Thup.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.120
My little sister.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.400
- Okay, all set, Inspector.
- Yes.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.600
What did you actually see.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.520
I think I saw my sister.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.600
But in the end,

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.320
it turned into a hollow-eyed ghost.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.800
That definitely wasn’t my sister.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.920
A hollow-eyed ghost.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.000
I think

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.480
it was definitely their doing.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.680
They probably sent it to target you.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.720
And with your body this weak,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.680
it makes it easier for them.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.600
Bastards.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680
They used my sister,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.480
who’s already dead, to come after me.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.920
Do you still feel guilty about your sister.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480
If there’s something weighing on your heart,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.400
you can tell me.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.400
Take her to a psychiatrist.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560
Trust me.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.640
She’s seriously ill.
She’s almost gone mad.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.840
Why are you saying things like that.
That’s your sister.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.120
Believe me.
No spirit doctors, no monks.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.800
- Go see a doctor.
- Singha.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.920
Back then, I didn’t believe
my sister was seeing ghosts.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.360
And my mom tried to treat my sister,

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.120
using occult methods.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.440
Mesa.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.040
Mesa.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200
Mesa.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.400
Where are you going.
Do your homework first.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.720
Come play with me.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.920
Come play with me.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.320
Follow me. Come on.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.040
One day, my mom told me

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.520
she found my sister,

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.640
dead by the river.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.320
If back then I had believed my mom,

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.280
and followed what she said,

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.640
Mesa might still be alive.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.560
You don’t have to feel guilty.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.600
People are born

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.120
with different ways of thinking.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.320
But if one day,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.920
we open our minds,

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.520
and come to understand it,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.880
that’s already enough.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.680
No one ever knows

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.480
when we’ll stay or when we’ll leave.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.120
But one thing’s certain.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.720
Mesa, your younger sister

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.680
She wouldn’t want to see you
suffering from nightmares like this.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.800
Forgive yourself.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.920
Thank you.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.480
For saving me.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.640
You’re the one

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.720
who saved me.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.400
Dry food.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.480
Shit.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560
P'King.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.400
Easy, Sey.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.200
How did you get here anyway.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.680
- What about the warrant.
- What use is a warrant now.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.720
You’re already inside.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.840
Sey.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.800
Go help Darin.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.640
I’ll take over here.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.640
You sure.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.040
Go stall for time.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.200
We’ll meet at the safe house.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880
Okay.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.520
Be careful.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.400
What are you doing to me.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.160
Stop.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.800
What is that.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.520
Sorted by birth day.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.280
- Yes.
- I was born on Friday.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.120
So it goes under Friday.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360
Friday.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.760
Friday is done.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.560
Friday.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.880
(Next Episode Preview)
Our goal now is to catch the real culprit.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.600
Inspector King was born on Friday.
Could he be taken and grouped with this set.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.720
Right now we need to find
who belongs to Thursday.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.000
P'Sing, what about Darin.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.720
We’ve located King.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.640
What if the one he wants isn’t me,
but someone else.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.120
It’s dangerous. Don’t go out.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.680
Once all seven are killed,the ritual will be
performed on the night of the new moon.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.080
The moonless night.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.360
(New director)
Then gently push him away, make it a bit sexy.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.280
(Looking very professional, Darin)
- See, that’s pro right there. / - Okay, got it. Let’s do that.

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.480
About to lose it already.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.360
Oh, no, no, no.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.760
How can a cop fall in love
with a murderer’s child.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.200
(Sudden kiss!!)

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.640
Can you stop talking now.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.440
If I don’t stop,

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.320
you won’t stop kissing me.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.160
