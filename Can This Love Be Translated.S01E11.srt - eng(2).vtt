WEBVTT

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.221
Welcome!

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.600
We've made it into the restaurant now!

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.185
It's packed with people.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.647
Without further ado,
let's talk to some customers.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.316
Excuse me, what's this you're eating?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.402
Momo-chan Ramen, of course.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:32.449
The Momo-chan Ramen
is this place's signature dish.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.200
Is that Momo-chan Ramen too?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.785
You know it!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.830
I can't wait to try it. It looks so good!

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.000
{\an8}This is the Momo-chan Ramen!

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:46.796
Spicy! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:53.053
{\an8}Surprisingly,
the chef behind this dish is Korean.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.387
{\an8}Mr. Kim Yu-jin.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.765
{\an8}Here you go.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.350
{\an8}Wow, this looks great.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:03.646
{\an8}What brought a chef
from a top hotel in Korea to Japan?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.733
{\an8}Apparently, it's all thanks to Eiko,
his beloved wife.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.526
{\an8}Delicious.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.614
{\an8}My wife and I are constantly trying

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.283
{\an8}to develop new flavors.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.455
{\an8}My husband's dream is to open
a Momo-chan Ramen branch in Korea.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.999
Thank you very much.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.628
I KNOW THE CHEF, HIS EX IS A CELEB

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.088
WHO?
YOU TROLL, DON'T LIE

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.130
DO RA-MI

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.673
HE'S CHA MU-HEE'S EX? FOR REAL?

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.342
RECEIPTS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.147
Careful.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:52.779
I'd been staying here.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:56.658
It's quiet and clean,
so I stay here whenever I'm in Italy.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.166
Good thing the key's still here.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.879
You were staying somewhere so nice.
Looks nicer than most hotels.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.997
The key was still there,
so you must have left the place like this.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.582
It's so clean.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.959
Do you always clean before leaving?

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.920
It just gives me peace of mind.
Wrapping everything up neatly.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:53.965
I'm not a very neat person.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.135
I spill things and make a mess.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.095
I know.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.724
But don't worry. I'm great at tidying up.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.770
Dry your hair properly,
or you'll catch a cold.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:12.233
This building's old,
so it'll take some time to heat up.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.242
I wouldn't have to impose on you like this

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.120
if I could flag down a cab quickly
and head back to the hotel.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.957
It's really hard to catch cabs in Italy.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.212
I could book one for you now on Grab.
Want me to?

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.129
No.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.256
I…

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:36.966
Well…

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.552
My hair.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.014
If I hop in a cab with my hair still wet,
I'll catch a cold.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:45.183
Let me dry up a little more
before I leave.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.188
Should I go?

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.981
What? No.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:07.205
Wait here. I'll make you something warm.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.807
There's coffee and hot chocolate.
Which do you prefer?

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.686
Just something sweet.
I'm totally craving something sweet.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.979
Something sweet.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:45.868
Mu-hee, where are you?

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.538
I heard Mr. Joo missed his flight.
Are you with him?

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.874
Yeah.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.878
It's snowing, so we're at the place
Mr. Joo Ho-jin was staying at.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.047
I'll head back once the snow stops.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.759
Are you insane?

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.599
Just stay there.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.478
I'm happy for you, Mu-hee.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.330
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.711
I just…

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:40.006
This place

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:44.594
is right by the café
where we'd meet every day,

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.846
so why didn't you bring me here?

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.478
I'm talking about Do Ra-mi.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.521
It would've been easier to meet her here.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.648
Way too dangerous.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.820
You said you remembered everything.
Then you must recall what she did to me.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:08.326
Then give me a reward
for passing the test.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.338
I really did
all sorts of ridiculous things.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:25.843
Where I bit you… Is it okay?

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.180
You got a really good bite,

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.182
so it hurt a lot.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.309
I'm sorry.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.105
She was a bit aggressive,
but I know everything thanks to her.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.233
What it is you fear

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.819
and what makes you so anxious.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.573
And you're okay with all of that?

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.746
Now you know what kind of person I am.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.627
If I said I was fine with it all
and that I understand you,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.795
would you believe me?

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.882
I'd like to say I would,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.011
but I don't want to put
too much pressure on you.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.347
And I'd feel bad to say I wouldn't.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.891
But I'd be lying if I told you

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.395
that I believe you wholeheartedly.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.567
To me, your words are more difficult
than Chalcatongo Mixtec.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.360
Chalca…

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.529
What is that?

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:30.283
Just the language that was voted
the world's most unique language.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.163
Right. I'm sure you find me
difficult to understand.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:37.582
You're right.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.710
If Do Ra-mi hadn't shown up,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.129
I'd never have understood and let you go.

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.216
But it doesn't matter anymore.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.845
I told you we're going to break up.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:58.352
Whether I get sick of you and let you go
or you leave, disappointed in me,

00:07:58.853 --> 00:07:59.687
this will end.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:05.318
If we go into this knowing that,
I don't think there's any need to worry

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.446
about understanding
or believing each other.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.576
That's true, but…

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.330
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.626
Are we really going to break up?

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.212
Really?

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.091
When exactly?

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.012
I'm

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.931
pretty confident

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.892
we'll last at least a month.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:38.935
How about you?

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.231
I also think

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.650
we won't break up within a month.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.653
Then let's date for a month
without any worry.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:13.719
Goodness.

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:16.973
What happened?

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:22.103
Looks like the power's out
from using the heater too much.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:29.235
This building's almost a century old,

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.904
so the wiring's pretty old.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.593
What should we do?

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:57.888
You tell me.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:02.893
What should we do?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.023
Want me to take you back?

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:14.322
I…

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.078
I…

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.002
want to stay with you.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:58.509
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.242
I'm sorry. It must have started.
Let's head back in.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.043
Stop.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.422
Stop it.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:23.135
I know

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.096
who you like.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.436
I've known for a long time now

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.231
that you like someone else.

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:42.905
Go.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.493
Goodbye,

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.454
zombie.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:23.070
Why do you think Mr. Joo
suddenly changed his flight?

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.283
His girlfriend must have asked him
to stay a little longer.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.996
I asked him in passing,
and he doesn't have a girlfriend in Italy.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:32.955
He doesn't?

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.916
So were we mistaken that day?

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.085
That reminds me.

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:41.422
Didn't you say he liked a girl
for a long time?

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:42.715
What happened with her?

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:46.719
I only heard about it from Jin-suk,
so I don't know who she is.

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:51.974
Why are you so interested
in Ho-jin's love life anyway?

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:55.561
Because I have my eye on him
as a noncelebrity contestant.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.271
He's such a catch.

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.398
It would make for great TV.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.860
Looks like something not so great
just happened.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.320
What happened?

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:08.115
A trending post online claims
that Ms. Cha Mu-hee dated a married man.

00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:09.199
- What?
- What?

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:10.826
Let me see that.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.661
PHOTO EVIDENCE OF CHA MU-HEE'S AFFAIR

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.955
THIS RAMEN CHEF WHO WAS ON TV
IS CHA MU-HEE'S EX

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.458
THEY EVEN MET IN JAPAN
WHILE HIS WIFE WAS PREGNANT

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:22.671
{\an8}They say Ms. Cha's ex is a chef
who now runs a ramen restaurant in Japan.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:26.425
The period Mu-hee dated him
lines up with his wife's pregnancy.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:28.719
Goodness.

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.179
Who's this guy?

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.808
This is a picture Mu-hee took of him
on a trip to Enoshima.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.978
It was taken
near his restaurant on April 8th,

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.522
during his wife's pregnancy.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.232
April 8th?

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.443
- It was taken on April 8th?
- Yeah.

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:48.155
Why? What?
Is that day significant or something?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.865
That's my birthday.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.536
Hey, this guy.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.121
{\an8}Is he really that chef?

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.792
{\an8}I can't tell just from his side profile.
Isn't this a bit of a stretch?

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.544
She deleted the post
after blowing up as Do Ra-mi.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.171
In the Instagram world,

00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:07.299
unfollowing someone or deleting a post
can serve as proof.

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:11.553
They were here that day?

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:12.930
Tell me about it.

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:16.725
Why'd Ms. Cha Mu-hee have to be there
and make herself look suspicious?

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.310
You don't think all this

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:20.604
will hurt our show, do you?

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.817
It's probably nothing,
but I'll look into it as soon as we land.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.776
Okay.

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.252
Hiro.

00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:47.631
You should get ready for the airport.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.759
You slept here?

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:52.928
Hiro.

00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:56.390
Hiro.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:06.442
Hiro?

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.360
Hiro!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.524
I'll buy us food and drinks.

00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:49.860
There's water in the fridge.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.642
What did you get?
Did you grab us some juice?

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.685
Mu-hee, I need to leave now.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.314
- Why?
- Nanami called to say Hiro passed out.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.400
- What?
- I need to go help interpret.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.945
You should get back and catch your flight.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:43.080
What the heck is all this?

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.167
I was just sleeping,
and you stuck a needle in my arm?

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.920
You even called a doctor.
What did you think I'd done?

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:51.922
I apologize.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.758
I know you're not as tough as you look,

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:57.010
but you wouldn't act so foolish
over heartbreak.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:58.929
I jumped the gun.

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:03.308
I forgot I'd taken my allergy meds
and had a few drinks. That's all.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:04.935
And Joo Ho-jin?

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.230
Why'd you call that guy?
This is so embarrassing!

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:12.025
Now that I think about it,
this must be embarrassing for you.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.571
Then why don't you stay passed out?

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:17.948
Don't be ridiculous.

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.033
But

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.744
he should have flown back by now.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.329
Why is he still here?

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.875
I don't know.
I haven't had the chance to ask him.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:32.629
Here he comes.
Would you like to ask him yourself?

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:43.223
The doctor says it was a side effect
of the antihistamines he took.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.186
He also says there's no need to worry.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.813
Once the IV's done

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.483
and he's rested, he should be fine
to catch his flight today.

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:54.902
Thank you.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.864
Has he slept the whole time
without waking once?

00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:01.283
Yes, he has.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.119
Excuse me.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.037
Sure.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.372
Hello?

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.806
Why are you still here?

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.146
Good morning.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.317
Are you feeling all right?

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.110
I'm all right.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.157
Your flight was yesterday,

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.284
so why are you still here?

00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:46.912
Did you meet Cha Mu-hee yesterday?

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:50.791
I did.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.801
You're probably under the impression

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:04.888
that yesterday, you interpreted
my first confession to her.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.308
But in reality,

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.187
I had already told her many times before,

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:17.526
though she hadn't understood
because I told her in Japanese.

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.114
If…

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.660
she and I spoke the same language,

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:30.539
and if she could understand
everything I had said

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:33.458
and my feelings toward her…

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:37.838
do you think I could have

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.883
won her over before you did?

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.971
To be honest,

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:49.224
I also had trouble
understanding her words.

00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.936
I came close to giving up many times,

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:55.814
but, luckily enough,

00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:59.526
a wonderful interpreter appeared

00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:03.655
who helped me understand her.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:06.241
An interpreter?

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:08.869
Yes.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.249
Get well soon.

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:18.795
This is bad. Something's come up
on Ms. Cha Mu-hee's end.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:21.423
It's a scandal.

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:23.884
Already?

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.344
Not with you!

00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:27.929
- Then who? Me?
- Not you either, Hiro.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.935
People are saying she had an affair
with a married man.

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:35.937
An affair?

00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:41.777
- The person you're calling…
- Why aren't they answering?

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.323
People are saying we had an affair?

00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:48.367
But this jerk cheated on me!

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.744
This motherfucker!

00:22:50.827 --> 00:22:52.454
He's screwing me over again!

00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:00.379
{\an8}Inside Do Ra-mi's affair allegations.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:04.508
{\an8}The man is a chef who has a Japanese wife
and a 15-month-old baby.

00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:08.804
{\an8}His wife was pregnant at the time
Mu-hee is said to have met him in Japan.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.639
{\an8}As the affair allegations ran rampant,

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.475
{\an8}Cha Mu-hee posted an IG story saying,
"My blood is boiling."

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:16.269
{\an8}People were split.
Was it an affair, or was he two-timing?

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.146
{\an8}Then Cha Mu-hee posted a photo.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.402
{\an8}It was a photo she'd taken
with his wife and baby at the ramen shop.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:26.530
{\an8}Proving she's still friends with her ex?
Do Ra-mi's so chill.

00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:27.823
{\an8}Either way, not an affair.

00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:32.369
{\an8}What a tumultuous three weeks
since getting back from Italy.

00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:34.788
Luckily, word got out
about an idol couple two days ago,

00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.456
taking the spotlight off Mu-hee.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.169
She even posted a cozy photo
with the guy and his wife,

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.381
yet some people still think
they had an affair.

00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:47.843
You can't stop people
who endlessly post hate comments.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:51.888
Mu-hee sure is easygoing, isn't she?

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:54.766
Being close friends with her ex's wife.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.601
They're not close.

00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:58.770
Apparently, he cheated on Mu-hee with her.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.063
- What?
- What?

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:02.607
She thought arguing
would only lead to more talk

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.401
and decided to say they're friends.

00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:06.820
The quickest, clearest way
to put things to rest.

00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:08.780
What a douchebag. A son of a…

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:13.118
Damn, Mu-hee must've been pissed.

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.370
Ji-sun, how do you know all that?

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.330
Did Yong-u tell you?

00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:18.665
What?

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:20.417
Yeah.

00:24:21.084 --> 00:24:23.628
Then what about this guy
in the photo from Japan?

00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:26.298
If it isn't that chef, who is it?

00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:40.729
Hey.

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.535
He's the one who translated for you
when you met Eiko, isn't he?

00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:59.206
The man in the Enoshima photo
who's the spitting image of me.

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:02.959
He looks nothing like you.

00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:05.504
Everyone thinks he looks just like me.

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:10.258
You saw him. They look nothing alike.

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.676
Don't we look alike?

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:16.097
I don't really remember,

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:20.810
but I think you both have thoughtful eyes
and a regal air about you.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:21.811
You do?

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:25.565
But saying you two look alike
makes it seem as though

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:29.528
she's dating a man who resembles you
because she's still not over you.

00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.988
Tell her you don't look alike,
so she won't be upset.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.242
- She says we don't look alike.
- Right?

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:39.287
What are you doing in Korea anyway?

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:41.623
I'm here on business,

00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:44.417
but I came to say thank you.

00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.127
Mu-hee.

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:49.756
Thanks to your Instagram post about me,
I'm super famous.

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:50.840
Thanks.

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.009
Thank you so much.

00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:58.598
I even got the chance to launch a meal kit
on an e-commerce site.

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.101
I brought some for you to try.

00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:04.145
Could you give it a try
and post it on Instagram?

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.315
Get this out of my face.

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:08.984
Sorry.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.073
I'll go change his diaper. Excuse me.

00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.877
We only said we were friends
because of the situation.

00:26:27.961 --> 00:26:29.254
We're not actually friends.

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.507
I'm your horrible ex-boyfriend
who two-timed you,

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.010
ghosted you,
and moved on to someone else in no time.

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.511
Exactly.

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:39.848
So take these and leave.
I never want to see you again.

00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:41.683
I'm sorry.

00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:44.436
I'm only doing this out of urgency.

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:47.939
The truth is, my son is sick.

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:51.651
He's had heart problems
since before he was born.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.906
I need to make money quickly
to pay for his surgery.

00:26:57.407 --> 00:27:00.410
I know it's shameless,
but I was hoping to piggyback off you.

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:06.041
I heard he was her ex-husband's son.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:06.958
Yeah.

00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:11.171
After getting divorced
while pregnant with a sick baby,

00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.340
Eiko wasn't in a good place.

00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:17.927
I said she should still give birth
and that I'd take care of him.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.682
Which means he's my son now.

00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:26.311
Mu-hee.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.358
The heavier the burden
of carrying my family,

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.943
the lighter my ego became.

00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.252
How dare you try
to sell me your sob story!

00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:54.255
In the end,
you're still a jerk and a traitor.

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:55.757
You're right.

00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:58.218
I am a jerk

00:27:58.802 --> 00:27:59.719
but not a traitor.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:00.762
What?

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.639
The whole time we were dating,

00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:05.433
you believed I was going to leave you.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.395
Since I did end up leaving,
I didn't betray that trust.

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:09.729
So I'm not a traitor.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.356
Yeah.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.650
I was constantly anxious.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.485
And in the end, I was right.

00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.237
In the words of Laozi,

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:23.076
"To be anxious is to live
with your mind in the future."

00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:27.497
Mu-hee, my ex-girlfriend
who had love by her side,

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.792
yet lived in a future
where that love had already fallen apart.

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:35.422
Try living in the present
with the guy you're seeing now.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:38.341
Keep your advice, jerk.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.343
I may be a jerk, but I worry about you.

00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:44.305
It's no joke,
being associated with a celebrity.

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:49.102
People dug up every detail
about me and even Eiko's ex-husband.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.354
If people dig this much into an ex,

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:53.565
it must be worse
for your current boyfriend.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.651
I figured that must be making you anxious.

00:28:57.444 --> 00:29:00.363
I guess fame certainly has its drawbacks.

00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.076
Sorry.

00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:16.629
If I do post about this,
don't you dare comment.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.509
I hope you get filthy rich.

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.638
Don't forget the hashtag
Momo-chan Ramen. Thanks.

00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:26.806
Thank you!

00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:35.774
She showed up and made a scene,
claiming to be a part of this family too.

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:38.359
And now what? An affair?

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:42.238
She did release a statement denying it.

00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.201
Like mother, like daughter, I guess.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.036
They say blood will tell.

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:52.040
Your brother's blood
also runs in her veins.

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.505
Mu-hee is the very image of that woman.

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.340
Shockingly so.

00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.389
I do know Mr. Cha,
chairman of the Myeongjin Foundation,

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.100
since I lectured at that university.

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:14.896
Do you know anything about his family?

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.982
One of his brothers passed, right?

00:30:20.443 --> 00:30:21.569
Yes, that's right.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:25.073
Chairman Cha said he had two brothers.

00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:30.036
I believe the second eldest
runs a business somewhere in China,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.665
and the youngest brother died young.

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.501
I heard he was in some sort of accident.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.379
Do you know what sort of accident exactly?

00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:41.673
No, I wouldn't know that much about it.

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:46.302
Ask Mr. Oh when he gets here.
They were classmates, so he'd know.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.892
Why the interest in his family?

00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:59.732
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, the actress,
is from that family, isn't she?

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:02.318
I read the articles.

00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.948
Why? Are you going to marry her?

00:31:07.949 --> 00:31:09.075
Wanna meet her family?

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.411
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:15.748
So there's actually something
for me to get ahead of?

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:18.626
Yes.

00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:23.798
That's great. Congratulations.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.845
I must ask.

00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:33.474
Is Ms. Cha Mu-hee okay?
There's been a lot of chatter.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:35.018
You saw that too?

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.646
People say she dated a married man.
That's not true, is it?

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.107
Of course not. You believed that?

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.318
No.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.486
It's just everyone was saying it.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.571
Mr. Kim.

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:50.325
"Just because most people believe it
doesn't make it true."

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.368
"Truth is not decided by a majority vote."

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:54.454
Those are words you wrote in your book.

00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:56.539
How could the writer of those words

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:59.042
believe mindless gossip and speculation?

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.170
I didn't really think it was true.

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.797
But you had your doubts and suspected her.

00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:06.633
If not, then fine. What's with you?

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.051
"If not, never mind"?

00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:11.554
It's that kind of irresponsible thinking
that cuts even deeper.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.724
Why are you having a go at me?
What did I do?

00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:17.644
The fact that you,
a so-called leading literary figure…

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:23.107
fell for such baseless, exaggerated gossip

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.276
is really, truly,

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:27.362
deeply disappointing.

00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:32.533
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.535
I'm

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:36.829
really,

00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:38.289
truly,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.958
deeply sorry.

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.044
I think I'll call it a day.

00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:47.173
Hey, you said you wanted to talk
to Mr. Oh about something.

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:49.384
He's coming here for a drink after work.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.802
I'll speak to him separately.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.220
Why?

00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:56.891
You won't even play a game of baduk
with a man who runs his mouth?

00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.146
Get home safe.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.197
And I was so close to winning.

00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:14.033
Did the two of you argue?

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.954
Oh, come on, madam.

00:33:18.454 --> 00:33:20.373
Do you really think, at my age,

00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:23.418
I'd argue with someone
young enough to be my son?

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.005
He gave me a good scolding

00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:28.423
for running my mouth.

00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:32.343
Deary me.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:36.973
He can't exactly round up everyone
gossiping about her and scold them all.

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:42.103
It must be weighing on him.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.697
ASSOCIATE PARK JI-MIN

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.325
JUST SENT MATERIALS FOR THE UPCOMING
CONFERENCE INTERPRETATION. PLEASE REVIEW

00:34:00.663 --> 00:34:01.497
MS. CHA MU-HEE

00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:02.832
MR. JOO, DID YOU LAND OKAY?

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:04.751
I DID. DON'T WORRY. IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:08.004
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, I don't think
we can meet for the time being.

00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:10.923
I'll be in touch once things settle down.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.402
PAPAGO♥

00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:38.493
ALL RIGHT. SPEAK SOON

00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:48.044
If people dig this much into an ex,

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:50.129
it must be worse
for your current boyfriend.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.768
Get some rest, Mu-hee.

00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:15.238
As you instructed,
we posted about taking legal action,

00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:17.198
and most posts about the affair are gone.

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.367
- Manager Kim Yong-u.
- Yes?

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.994
The man in the photograph
she took in Japan.

00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:24.747
Are you sure
there's nothing going on with him?

00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:29.001
She said he was just
someone she met while traveling.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.339
- Is he a celebrity?
- No, he's not.

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:35.883
Yong-u.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:39.262
If she gets caught up
in dating rumors now,

00:35:39.345 --> 00:35:42.932
not only will it hurt her,
but it will make things tough on that guy.

00:35:43.015 --> 00:35:45.768
Mu-hee knows,
which is why she hasn't seen him in weeks.

00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:47.436
She's being extremely careful.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.896
Well, be more careful.

00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:52.775
And you got a call from the sports agency.

00:35:53.442 --> 00:35:55.611
You took this job
to transfer there eventually.

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:57.280
You can start there next month.

00:35:58.823 --> 00:35:59.782
Thank you, sir.

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:03.369
No need to thank me. And call me uncle
when it's just the two of us.

00:36:03.452 --> 00:36:05.079
Your mom will be happy, won't she?

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.915
- Who will I be working with?
- Brace yourself.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.792
You're headed to Europe, baby.

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:12.211
- A player on a European team?
- Yeah.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.215
Do I have to go right away though?

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.467
Hell yeah, you do. First, get your visa.

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:21.888
Then you'd best brush up on your English.
You get me?

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:23.389
- Uncle?
- Yeah?

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.142
Could I delay going by about three months?

00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:28.853
No, about six months?

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:32.023
Kim Yong-u. Is this about a woman?

00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:40.406
We just started dating, and I think
it'll be over if I leave for Europe now.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.993
And are you sure it won't be over
if you leave in six months?

00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.623
It's not like she has no interest in me.

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.708
Yong-u, my dear nephew. Look.

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.461
You need to choose your target.

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:56.005
Is it your dream or love?
Stick your finger out.

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.508
You only have a single bullet.

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.956
Why was he on that island on my birthday?

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.518
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.485
The passcode.

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:44.822
You hadn't changed it,
so I decided to wait inside.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:47.616
Long time no see, babe.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.077
Babe?

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:56.709
It's me, Do Ra-mi.

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:01.130
I came to say something.

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:05.009
You must be surprised
I showed up out of the blue…

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:08.929
Then again, no. I've been here before,
so it should be fine.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.390
I don't care either way,

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.101
but why are you wearing that?

00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:16.812
Right, this gown.

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:20.316
Do Ra-mi wore it last time,
so I thought I'd look more like her if I…

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:23.277
Is that right?

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.280
Go on. What do you have to say?

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:34.288
I'm here to say something
Cha Mu-hee could never say herself.

00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:36.415
What is it?

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:38.459
Well…

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.713
Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:45.633
No, I mean…

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:48.511
If you hear this, babe,

00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:52.223
you might be floored and even pissed off,

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:56.435
but, given recent events,
it can't be helped.

00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:58.896
It's already decided,

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:01.816
so I hope you can accept it.

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.652
Seems like you're feeling awkward.
You're rambling.

00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.905
- I'd think you were Ms. Cha Mu-hee.
- I'm Do Ra-mi.

00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.244
Yes, you are Do Ra-mi.

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:18.207
You look ugly. My Cha Mu-hee is pretty
no matter what she does.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.001
She's pretty when she smiles,
pretty when she cries,

00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:23.337
and pretty when she's mad.

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:27.466
But Do Ra-mi is a bit of an eyesore,
whatever she does.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.718
Do Ra-mi or Cha Mu-hee, we look the same.

00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:33.013
That's enough. Ugly Do Ra-mi,
tell me what you have to say.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.308
Whatever ugly words
you have to say, I'll listen.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.232
It's okay…

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.653
if you want to break up
with Cha Mu-hee now.

00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:58.289
You refused to follow an Instagram account
to avoid celebrity drama.

00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:01.333
Get mixed up with Cha Mu-hee now…

00:41:03.335 --> 00:41:05.588
and people will dig up
every detail about you.

00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:08.549
This time,
you were mistaken for a cheater,

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:09.717
but next time,

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:13.220
people might accuse you
of being a fraud or a liar.

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:16.807
Before you're put through something worse…

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.312
you should

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:24.607
just end things now.

00:41:29.945 --> 00:41:31.030
I don't want to.

00:41:33.866 --> 00:41:36.160
There's nothing to dig up
that I'd be ashamed of,

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.915
and I won't be swayed or hurt
by such unfounded, inflated rumors.

00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:48.422
You may be fine now,
but you won't be later.

00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:50.090
Why worry about what happens later?

00:41:51.091 --> 00:41:52.510
We'll be breaking up anyway.

00:41:57.264 --> 00:41:58.557
So, for now,

00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:00.768
we won't break up

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:03.979
over something like that.

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:16.075
I appreciate your concern
and you're coming here to advise me,

00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:18.077
but, Ms. Do Ra-mi,

00:42:18.577 --> 00:42:20.079
could you please leave now?

00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:23.249
I'd really like to see Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.589
Still, let's agree

00:42:31.257 --> 00:42:32.967
that you only met Do Ra-mi today.

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:38.973
It feels way too shameless to own up
to being Cha Mu-hee now and to thank you.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.893
And if I say I don't remember,
I'll just sound completely insane.

00:42:43.686 --> 00:42:45.396
I'm okay either way.

00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:47.648
I'm used to your antics by now.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:52.903
Even so,

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:56.156
it's a bit… awkward.

00:42:58.284 --> 00:42:59.201
I mean,

00:43:00.202 --> 00:43:02.246
I've never

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.957
transformed in front of you…

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.041
Sorry, what?

00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:08.502
- Transformed.
- Right, transformed.

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:12.756
And I'm not sure
how to go about it either.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.467
Then

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:18.554
why don't we say that once you

00:43:19.346 --> 00:43:20.347
take off that gown,

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.642
you've transformed?

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:27.938
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:32.109
Right.

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.278
Then,

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.655
trans…

00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:39.825
Transformation…

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.289
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:48.292
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:53.172
Hey, why are you laughing?
I shouldn't have transformed.

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.222
I missed you.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.266
And I was worried about you.

00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:10.481
I really missed you too.

00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.281
You're so good at transforming.

00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:25.037
Are you on the train?

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.747
It'll leave soon. Where are you?

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.165
I'm heading to the edit room.

00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:31.460
I could've watched the footage later,
but Ms. Cho insisted I go today.

00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:34.672
Otherwise, I would have gone to Busan too.

00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:40.636
I have back-to-back meetings.
I couldn't spend time with you anyway.

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:44.473
Who said I'd be following you there?
I just want to go to Busan, that's all.

00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:48.727
The meeting will run long,
so I'll be home late.

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:55.234
If it gets too late,
just sleep there and come back tomorrow.

00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:58.362
I don't want to.
Then I won't be able to see you today.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.075
I want to see you,
so I'm coming home, even if it's late.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.205
All right, then.

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:09.790
Then

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.084
have a safe trip.

00:45:12.167 --> 00:45:14.044
I'll message you once I arrive.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.379
Bye.

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:25.973
If he'd said he was staying the night,
I'd have gone to Busan.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.772
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is here.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.152
Mu-hee! You must have been
under a lot of stress.

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.028
I'm glad it's over.

00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.739
Sorry for worrying you.

00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.824
It's okay. I heard the whole story.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.202
You must have been through a lot. Sit.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.583
I asked you here today
because I thought we should chat

00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:55.377
before we finish editing
the last castle shoot.

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:57.671
Hiro's on his way too.

00:45:58.505 --> 00:45:59.673
Hiro's coming here today?

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:05.679
Is he mad at me
because of the whole affair thing?

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.097
No.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.684
In fact, Mu-hee,
Hiro helped you out a lot.

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:12.519
He buried all the articles in Japan

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:15.105
by putting out early promo articles

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.399
and giving preemptive interviews.

00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.610
All to make it seem
like there are no issues.

00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:21.403
He did?

00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:25.991
I'm so grateful.

00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:31.997
I called you here today to discuss
Hiro's confession at the old castle.

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.833
Can we really include that in the show?

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:38.712
What's wrong with that?

00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:43.550
It wasn't even a real confession.
Just a line for the show.

00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:48.055
No, it wasn't.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.474
He meant it.

00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:53.727
Didn't you know?

00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:03.403
Hey, Hiro's here.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.822
Hello.

00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:21.338
The train will be leaving soon.
Please check your tickets.

00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:22.464
Ho-jin?

00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:26.969
Ji-sun.

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:35.602
You're going to Busan?

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.604
Yeah, I'm interpreting at a meeting.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.982
I have some business at my parents'.

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.427
Hiro.

00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:12.973
Are you feeling better?

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:14.766
Are you okay?

00:48:16.476 --> 00:48:17.311
Yeah.

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:24.192
I heard you helped me out.

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:26.695
Thank you.

00:48:33.118 --> 00:48:35.746
I'll need to know
more than "Okay, thank you"

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:37.372
to have a proper conversation.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:43.170
When will Nanami be joining us?

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:58.936
He meant what he said to me
at the old castle?

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.024
How do I ask what he meant?

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:08.904
Old castle.

00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:16.828
Would he understand that?

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.999
This really isn't something
to ask so casually.

00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:25.212
Ask me.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.968
I understand Korean pretty well now.

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:34.054
I studied pretty freaking hard.

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:43.897
Then…

00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:49.486
did you understand everything I just said?

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:52.990
Castle, love, really?

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.660
Yes, really.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.834
I'm in the seat next to you again.

00:50:06.628 --> 00:50:09.840
Remember, this is how we met?

00:50:10.924 --> 00:50:12.217
On a plane to Japan.

00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:14.428
You do remember.

00:50:18.473 --> 00:50:20.392
Given this unbelievable coincidence,

00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:23.729
I can't help but ask.

00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:26.606
Ask what?

00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:29.568
Enoshima.

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:34.406
The birthday present I wanted.

00:50:35.073 --> 00:50:36.324
Do you remember that too?

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:45.292
I'll answer your question.

00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:54.843
I really liked

00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:57.262
you.

00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:07.397
Why did you go to Enoshima Island
on my birthday?

00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:10.901
Did you, by any chance,

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.611
like me?

00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:28.126
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:53.438
