[Love Between Lines]

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.729
[Episode 18]

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.450
Two bowls of wontons, please.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.840
Okay.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.130
Sit wherever you like.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.430
Auntie Li, long time no see!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.870
Here to see your best friend again?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.590
She's been waiting here for a while.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.000
She just went to the restroom.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.680
I know.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680
She said she already bought everything.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.240
Go ahead and sit.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.560
What would you like to order?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.680
Two pan-fried buns, please.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680
Okay, no problem.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.490
Why did she get so much takeout?

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.040
I'm starving.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.120
This is for you.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.079
Okay. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.860
Sorry, this seat is taken.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.150
It's okay.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.270
You can sit here for a bit if you like.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.620
These are our local zongzi.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.750
Thank you.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.220
Guangming?

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.130
Guangming!

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.350
Weren't you supposed to get me wontons?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.540
What's going on here?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.500
And where are my super-famous
pan-fried buns from Xiyuan?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.440
[I just went to the restroom and hung
the pan-fried buns on the shop's door.]

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.530
Where are they?

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.190
[Those are the super-famous pan-fried buns
from Xiyuan. Remember to grab them.]

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.650
Right there, aren't they?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.310
I'll transfer the money to you.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.960
No need.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:47.590
Okay.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.480
Next time...

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.280
Next time, you can treat me.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.400
Honey...

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.770
Sorry, I'm late.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.280
Not too early, not too late—

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.339
just right on time.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.100
You two haven't been here
in a long time, right?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.899
It's my fault.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.829
I've been too busy with work lately.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.350
It's good for young people to stay busy.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.280
Enjoy your meal.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.120
Honey,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.250
I'll have plenty of time
to spend with you now.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.510
I've completed
all the resignation procedures

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.430
at Longyuan,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.890
and the new project
has been confirmed too.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.950
Then we really should

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.190
thank Chi Xin properly.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.640
You already know about my cooperation
with Zhiteng?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.880
I was planning to...

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.690
tell you about it when we got home.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.610
After the last exchange meeting,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.800
Zhiteng approached me for cooperation,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.660
and Chi Xin is the person
in charge of coordination.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.040
Why don't we

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.170
invite Chi Xin for a meal sometime soon?

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.770
To avoid any misunderstandings
in the future.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.730
I've already met her.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.040
At the park near the Zhiteng building.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.390
Honey.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.430
Listen to me...

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.770
Chi Xin and I are strictly professional.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.240
We're work partners.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.140
We only get together

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.670
to discuss the project.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.390
I have no feelings for her whatsoever

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.190
and never will.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.920
Yes.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.760
She tried to make a move on me.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.630
But I refused.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.590
I deflected all of it.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.240
She's my client.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.510
She has her projects,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.750
and I have my company.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.090
I can't just ignore my company and...

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.310
I was wrong.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.870
I'm also very tired.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.040
Can we talk about this at home...

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.480
Stop talking!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.970
Wang Guangming.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.010
Every word you're saying now...

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.270
is destroying our past.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.720
Let's just stop here.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.800
Well,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.200
I'll give you three days.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.190
Pack up your things and move out.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
This meal is on me.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.670
Zhao?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.520
Why are you sitting out here?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.480
Why don't you go inside?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.360
Did you forget?

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.960
When your boss rented your loft before,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.420
I returned the keys to you.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.660
I'll give them to you in a bit.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.750
Help me up.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.290
My feet have gone numb.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.510
Are you okay?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.670
I'm fine.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.750
Don't worry.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.730
But you'll have to
put me up for a few days.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.320
Mr. Pei.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.080
Come in.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.380
The financial report.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.920
Have a seat, Director Shen.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.950
You've been quite busy lately.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.410
I haven't seen you around.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.960
During the year-end settlement,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.850
some accounts weren't verified in time.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.690
I've been busy with that

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.690
the past few days.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.870
The financial report
was delayed by a few days.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.390
Sorry for causing you
some concern, Mr. Pei.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.200
It's fine.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.510
I'm on good terms with Mr. Xie.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.530
A quick word with him will sort it out.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.130
By the way,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.230
I heard from Wu Bin

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.710
that you rear-ended someone the other day.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.490
You're not usually so careless.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.350
What happened?

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.120
That day...

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.060
I was in a hurry to pick up my son
from kindergarten.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.860
I just wasn't paying attention.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.570
Mr. Pei,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.480
if there's nothing else,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.760
I'll get back to work.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.450
Give me your phone.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.950
Your son is quite adorable.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.860
He looks a lot like you.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.840
If there's financial fraud,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.360
the first one

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.610
they'll investigate is you—
the Financial Director.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.960
Do you want your son

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.080
to grow up with a father in prison?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.910
That day, outside my father's office,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.120
when I saw you leaving,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.980
I already felt something was off.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.540
So I had Wu Bin follow you.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.660
On top of that, you kept delaying
the financial report.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.640
What's the problem?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.910
Tell me.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.240
Director Shen,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.760
there's no need to hide things
between you and my father from me.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.720
After all, I'm a Pei too.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.930
It was all the Chairman's idea.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.700
The company's revenue

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.360
hasn't been great
over the past couple of years.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.940
I had no choice.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.720
What exactly is going on?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.030
Explain it to me clearly.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:49.960
Come in.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.240
How long were you

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.700
planning to hide the financials from me?

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.870
I just found out today

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.430
that the company has been

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.270
artificially inflating net profits
and fabricating transactions

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.390
for the past few years.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.440
Shen Jie has been scrambling
to pull funds from outside sources

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.790
to cover the shortfall on the books.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.270
Dad.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:18.870
If profits are declining,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.400
I can figure something out.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.110
I can start some new projects

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.910
or transfer some assets.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.570
But why take such a big risk?

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.360
Financial fraud

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.320
is illegal.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.030
In business,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.340
people only help those
who are already successful;

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.820
no one helps those in need.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.270
Only when a company shows good profits

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.790
can it secure more loans,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.840
and only then can it have
more opportunities to make money.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.480
So that's why you had someone doctor
the financial reports,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.680
hoping to turn losses into profits
with Lyman's project?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.880
We must proceed with Lyman's project.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.930
As long as the payments
come back smoothly,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.790
other risks are negligible.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.980
But once this is discovered

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.550
and people start digging,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.790
can the company really withstand
an investigation?

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.870
Whether it's fines or prison sentences,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.530
Forma's reputation
will be completely ruined!

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.860
All these years...

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.340
All these years,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.740
I've put my heart and soul

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.240
into keeping Forma standing.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:26.870
And you?

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.210
From the day you were born,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.310
you've only climbed a few steps,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.470
yet you're standing
at the top of the building,

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.070
looking down on everything.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.860
Remember this:

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.630
I paved those steps for you.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.450
And you've already walked halfway up.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.320
If the building ever collapses,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.390
you won't escape either.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.430
You should understand...

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.760
what needs to be done.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.750
Ms. Hu!

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.670
I was just talking with Mr. Pei...

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.480
Sorry.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.550
I think I left my phone
at the reception desk.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.840
Could you help me check?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.700
No problem. Please wait a moment.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:37.290
Mr. Pei,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.600
I'm here to pick up
the latest supplier information.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.010
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.190
Ms. Hu.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.750
Tell me,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.470
if the foundation has already been laid,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.440
does that mean construction

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.770
can only follow the original blueprints,

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.920
with no possibility of change?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.910
The foundation does determine

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.110
a building's structure and direction.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.980
It's the basis of everything, after all.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.060
It's difficult to change.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.410
But it's not absolute.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.610
Even if the foundation is completed,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.460
as long as the load distribution
isn't altered,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.349
you can modify

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.210
the building's exterior design.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.660
During construction,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.030
if there are any new building technologies
or standards,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.030
as long as they don't compromise
structural safety,

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.270
changes can be made.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:21.880
Mr. Pei,

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:26.089
so what ultimately decides
a building's final appearance

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.500
isn't the foundation,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.400
but your vision.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.940
I'll take these materials
back to the studio first.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.580
Goodbye.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.560
Mr. Xiao,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.070
here's the latest supplier information
from Forma.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.720
I guarantee nothing is missing.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.350
Why are you the one delivering this?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.720
Hu Xiu asked me to bring it over.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.790
She said she had nothing to report,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.850
so she didn't come.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.450
Where is she?

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.410
She's off work.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.550
She mentioned
her friend has a lot going on lately,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.750
so she's going to help out this weekend.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.110
Wang Guangming,
it's already been three days.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.880
Come back quickly,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.610
pack your things, and move out.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.640
Xiaorou,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.230
Guangming has gastric bleeding
and is in the hospital.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.560
You should go there now.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.620
We're the same—

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400
when something weighs on our minds,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.550
we keep ourselves busy like spinning tops,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.480
never stopping.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.480
But...

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.090
don't push your body too hard.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.440
I'm not.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.640
They're pressing
for the final installment.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.700
I want to finish this project quickly

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.000
so I can pay the final installment.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.110
That way...

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.640
maybe you'll stay.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.240
Wang Guangming.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.840
Now, when you speak,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.170
I find myself instinctively weighing

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.070
how sincere you really are.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.070
Not just now,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.590
but all those beautiful moments

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.200
we shared before—

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.530
I feel confused about everything.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.030
Do you remember our first date?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.340
On that street behind the school.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.310
That's when you held my hand
for the first time.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.400
At that time, we were both

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.350
so nervous our palms were sweaty,

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.960
and we smiled foolishly at each other.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.110
I think

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.850
at least then, you were sincere,
weren't you?

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.400
Back then,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.680
my school was far away.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.240
Whenever you had time,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.700
you'd take the subway
over 20 stops to see me.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.930
You'd bring lots of delicious food
from downtown

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.640
and tell me

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.030
that even if I grew to 200 pounds,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.560
you would never abandon me.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.750
I think

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.880
at least then, you were sincere.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.190
Near graduation,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.740
I got sick and was hospitalized.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.440
I didn't dare tell my parents about it.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.750
At the time, Hu Xiu was

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.080
overwhelmed with her father's surgery.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.760
You were the one who stayed up
night after night to take care of me.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.720
I think

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.270
at least then, you were sincere with me.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.860
So, when did you stop

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.480
being sincere?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.680
At the class reunion,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.640
when everyone praised us
as a model couple,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.720
were you genuinely happy,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.330
or were you thinking about the person
you were going to meet afterward?

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.880
When you gave me some freebie
as our anniversary gift,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.810
were you trying to get away with it,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.440
or did you truly just forget?

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.880
Did you ever feel any regret?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.830
I keep thinking about
all the kind things you did for me,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.430
all while being tormented
by those questions.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.030
Xiaorou.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.340
I can swear to you—

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.680
nothing ever happened

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.200
between Chi Xin and me,

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.460
except for that one kiss.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.790
I pushed her away that day.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.400
I went to explain to her...

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.880
Do you know why I'm telling you all this?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.030
Because our past was too beautiful.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.720
I really can't accept any impurities

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.200
in our relationship.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.000
You don't need to tell me

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.680
how far things went between you two,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680
what things are like now,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.540
or what will happen in the future.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.720
People who keep asking those questions

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.980
are just looking for reasons to forgive.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.970
But I'm not.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.610
Wang Guangming,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.740
let's both move on.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.160
Xiaorou...

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.100
But I still love you.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.960
I can't move on.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.300
We have so much history together,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.370
yet you can let it all go
in just a few days?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.720
I haven't let go.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.370
But it doesn't matter if I haven't.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.800
I've decided to stop loving you,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.850
so you've become nothing to me.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.570
Take care of yourself.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.640
Drawing on Souler's ideas,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.790
I've created a new dessert.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.720
I'm planning to call it "Rebirth."

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.810
Any dessert buddies want to try it?

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.350
I think this name was my suggestion.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.750
Glad I could help.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.440
Congratulations on breaking through
your creative block. Keep it up!

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.960
I've also opened a coffee shop.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.750
We should exchange ideas sometime.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.640
"Rebirth?"

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.270
I guess the name reflects you perfectly.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.800
Congratulations on finding yourself again.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.220
Mr. Gong, you're here.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.330
What are you looking at?
You look so happy.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.880
I just made a new special,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.080
and I'm checking everyone's feedback.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.950
The feedback is pretty good.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.980
By the way, are those pipes fixed now?

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.640
All replaced with new ones.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:50.660
Good.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.880
Want to try the new drink?

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880
It's on the house.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.030
Cocktail coffee.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.240
People usually have coffee in the morning
and alcohol at night,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.590
but yours is two in one.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.460
Alright, I've got to try it.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.590
Making new specials

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.390
and setting up collaborations—

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.370
you're quite efficient, Ms. Zhao.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.270
I have no choice.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.520
The café scene in Shanghai
is too competitive.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.580
If I want to build brand recognition,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.880
I need to come up with something new.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.830
This was

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.390
just an appetizer.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.820
This is the main course.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.840
[ME Murder Mystery Game Shop & Regard Café
Collab Event Proposal]

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.900
A collab event?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960
Earlier,

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.660
I was chatting with people
at the Virtual Party on this app

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.940
and got inspired.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.830
I think
our two businesses could collaborate.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.640
I could

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.820
design coffee drinks inspired
by murder mystery games.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.440
After players finish their games,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.400
they can come

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.750
to my Regard Café with their ticket stubs

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.950
and try them for free.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.680
We can also

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.110
organize offline events

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.440
at Regard,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.510
regularly hosting gatherings
for those players.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.440
That way, the storylines

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.400
from the murder mystery games
could extend into

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.920
many new side stories,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.480
which could even turn into
limited-edition board games.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.480
I believe

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.790
if this catches on,

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.910
your club

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.400
will definitely attract many new players.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.420
What?

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.680
You think I'm just trying to
ride on your club's popularity?

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.280
No.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.160
Not at all.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.500
It sounds good.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.310
I'll go back and look into it.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.590
I didn't expect

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.110
you'd be like

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.500
a different person after just a few days.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.190
[Divorce Agreement]

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.090
Sorry, wrong file.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.260
What do you think of Ms. Zhao's proposal?

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.750
I think it's good. Worth collaborating on.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.950
You came all the way to my place

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.280
just to talk about this?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.510
You invested money,

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.970
so of course, I needed to
ask your opinion.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.820
Do whatever you think is best.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.400
You have no objections?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.520
This trip was unnecessary then.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.640
Xiao,

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.070
are you on a hunger strike?

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.000
You don't even have any water
in your fridge.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.060
Forgot to buy some.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.440
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.680
You guys—none of you

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.060
are normal.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.480
One's practicing asceticism,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.880
not even drinking water,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.790
and barely answers when you talk to him.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.990
The other one seems to

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.790
have a split personality.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.720
A few days ago, she was acting
as if she were possessed,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.180
but now she's hyper,
like she's on steroids.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.470
And there's one more—

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.590
a violent maniac,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.210
venting all her anger
through murder mystery games every day.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:52.820
Violent maniac?

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.410
Will you cover this for me?

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.440
I mean Hu Xiu.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.970
She has been spending the whole weekend

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.700
playing murder mystery games.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.350
What's up with her?

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.920
She's gone on a killing spree.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.550
Literally.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.350
Qin Xiaoyi,

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.350
you're under arrest.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.720
Take him away.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.470
Move.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:25.690
Xu Xiuzhen,

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.480
I have no grievances with you.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.010
Why are you doing this to me?

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.160
-Move!
-Xu Xiuzhen!

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.450
Chen Xuemei,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.270
calm down!

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.920
Hold on, let's talk this through calmly!

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.460
Let's talk...

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.110
Wait.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.280
Why is it always Qin Xiaoyi
who ends up dead?

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.000
Li Yue has had it pretty rough
these past two days.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.690
Let's take a break, everyone.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:26.440
Okay.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.350
I have a massage gun at home.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.700
I'll bring it for you tomorrow?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.740
Don't bother.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.690
I'll just do some stretches later.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.810
I heard from Gong Huaicong

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:12.370
that you've been going to his club a lot
for murder mystery games lately.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.430
Is it really necessary
to go there so often?

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.200
What's wrong with that?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200
Aren't you tired?

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.540
There's been a lot of work lately.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:33.690
Don't waste your energy

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.820
and neglect what's really important.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.590
Mr. Xiao,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.170
may I ask what important matters
I have neglected?

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.630
I've completed
the technical disclosure work

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.780
with Forma.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.200
From design concepts
to construction points,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.640
and addressing the contractors' questions
about the drawings—

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.700
I've explained everything clearly.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.270
I've also finished
the construction progress plan

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.790
and submitted it
to Ms. Zhou for confirmation.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.030
And I've already collected
Forma's supplier information

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.590
and given it to you.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.110
I've also followed up with Lyman
about their financial report.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.000
Mr. Xiao, may I ask—
since I've completed all the work,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.530
what exactly is my problem?

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:12.320
Nothing.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.000
Then please, Mr. Xiao,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.680
don't overly concern yourself

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.010
with employees' personal arrangements.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.440
What was I even doing?

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.900
I can't afford to offend him,

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.020
but at least I can avoid him.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.400
Zhao,

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.690
you've been coming home
later and later lately.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.160
After finishing work at the café

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.590
and having meetings with Gong Huaicong,

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.720
it's already 11 PM before I realize it.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.760
Oh, right.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.200
Here.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.840
[Free Pass]

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.030
If I'd known I could get free passes,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.310
I should've

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.240
gotten you to collaborate

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.440
with Mr. Gong sooner.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.640
Your ulterior motives are so obvious.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.070
Gong Huaicong has been giving me

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.240
all the fill-in tickets these days,

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.400
and those still aren't enough for you?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.440
Enough, really.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.790
It's all thanks to you

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.030
that I got to play so many free games.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.110
Remember that.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.050
There's a delivery for you.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.350
To you.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.490
[Divorce Agreement]

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.550
Zhao...

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.880
What are your plans going forward?

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.000
The Regard Café account

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.930
has reached over 2,000 followers.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.850
I'm planning

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.410
to get the collab event started
right away.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.850
Who knows, maybe it'll hit 10,000.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.680
You all know about

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.830
our two stores collaborating, right?

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.230
I've developed several new coffee drinks.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.440
Their names and flavors

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.970
are all inspired
by the murder mystery games.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.480
Later,

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.720
they'll be available at Rongcheng Café

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.400
and my café simultaneously.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.240
I invited you all here today

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.720
so you can sample our new products
in advance

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.180
and give me some feedback.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.350
Let me introduce them to you.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.070
This latte with ice cream

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.640
is called "Rongcheng Snowy Night."

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.920
What's the name of

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.800
this milk pudding coffee?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.760
"Bits of Silver."

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.840
Xiu came up with the name.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.550
This basic milk coffee

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.989
is called "Perfect Partners."

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.120
Ms. Zhao, how's the discussion going?

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.080
Why did you two come here together?

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.070
Didn't you say you wouldn't
get involved in the collaboration?

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.440
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.440
Your intentions are crystal clear.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.030
I'm here to discuss

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.239
the specific details with Ms. Zhao.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.460
We still have two hours
before the evening session anyway,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.400
so there's no rush to go back.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.360
Let's treat this as a get-together

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.150
and chat for a while.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:34.590
Okay.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.510
Come on, sit with us.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.909
Zhiyu, sit here, come on.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.070
Hello,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:49.989
excuse me.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.870
Which lady are these flowers for?

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.550
Not for me.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.100
I just became single again.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.400
I-Isn't there a name written on the card?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.340
There is a name.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.280
It says...

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.720
"Baby."

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.740
I'll make a call to ask.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.800
My boyfriend and I

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.630
have been dating for less than a week.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.000
We didn't expect these flowers
to be for you.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.460
After all, weren't you...

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.590
I did have a crush on Zhiyu before.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.110
I thought Qin Xiaoyi was handsome,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.840
so I couldn't separate the character
from the person playing him.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.880
It's fine to get immersed,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.680
but sooner or later, you wake up.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.240
Ms. Hu, you must understand what I mean.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.620
You've played so many sessions before.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.350
Wasn't it

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.970
all because of Qin Xiaoyi?

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.280
No, no, I...

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.710
I like him...

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.530
Qin Xiaoyi's character setup.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.110
Actually, after playing so many sessions,

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.110
I think either of them
could play the role just as well.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.510
True.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.630
Xiu, haven't you been playing
in the sessions

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.510
where Li Yue plays the role lately?

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.110
Zhiyu,

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.550
actually, Li Yue has been performing
really well recently.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.400
Don't be discouraged.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.800
Just fix the issues, and you'll be fine.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.000
What issues do I have?

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.030
Well...

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.360
sometimes you try too hard to look cool.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.290
You should try to
get into the character's mind more.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.630
For example, that line
at the gate of Qincheng—

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.110
you could raise your pitch like this:

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.510
"Welcome to Rongcheng."

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:33.920
Right?

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.370
Or lower it, like this:

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.320
"Welcome to Rongcheng."

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320
What do you think?

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.420
I think Group B's

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.880
Qin Xiaoyi is just average.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.030
I mainly came for Group A's.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.250
The two portrayals are different.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.670
It's normal to have different preferences.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.450
Group A's Qin Xiaoyi is sharper,

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.180
more perceptive, and precise.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.920
Those who like him find him very charming,

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.570
but others find him
too dangerous and oppressive.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.150
Group B's Qin Xiaoyi is
sunnier and clearer.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.150
He's closer to a real-life person—

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.110
he makes mistakes and feels fear.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.760
That makes his tragedy
easier for the audience to relate to.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.190
Perhaps he's not strong enough,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.990
but that kind of portrayal
isn't necessarily bad.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.530
We're clearly different.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.580
How can you say we're the same?

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.650
You're here again.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.550
With a perk this good,

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.010
it'd be a shame to waste it.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.490
Li Yue is playing in this session, right?

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.720
Liu Rushi,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.320
a literary scholar.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.540
You must obtain the sapphire ring

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.280
♪ What identity do you use
to enter and exit the role? ♪

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.480

♪ Time and space interlace;

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.070
Thank goodness.

Otherwise, with you in the session,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.090
I'd end up dead again at your hands
without even knowing how.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.630
♪ Love overlaps in destiny ♪

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.960

playing Qin Xiaoyi this session.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.920

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.840
No, it's too late.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.870

I apologize for the inconvenience,
distinguished guests,

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.420

Li Yue.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.610
I'll play in this session.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.000
I've already spoken with Gong Huaicong.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.460
He said a scheduled player
couldn't make it,

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.750
so you need to fill in.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.320
Okay.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.360
Thanks.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.190
The fill-in ticket I gave Hu Xiu

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.250
is for the Sunday afternoon session.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.170
Murphy's Law never fails.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.380
The more you don't want to see him,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.510
the more he appears.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.970
Finally, there's someone
who can keep you in check.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.280
You don't want to see him that badly—

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.810
you're afraid
you can't beat him, aren't you?

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.840
What?

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.630
You want to use him against me

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:47.800
to get some payback?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280
No, no, not at all.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.630
I came hoping we could team up.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.320
As long as I can get Qin Xiaoyi's ring,

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.280
I can use its serial number

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.810
to find out the mysterious backer
behind him.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.360
So you're trying to trick me

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.190
into doing your dirty work?

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.440
What are you talking about?

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.840
I'm not tricking you.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.800
As long as we can get that ring,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.630
I'll do whatever you say.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.480
Hello, sir.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.280
Your coffee.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.260
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.450
Commander Qin.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.120
I'm really sorry.
Let me help you clean up.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:31.730
It's fine.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.980
I came to give you urgent news.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.000
There are some people

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.350
causing trouble over
at the Military Affairs Office.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.750
Please come with me quickly
to check it out.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.080
Miss,

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.490
I believe this ring belongs to me.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:51.960
Yes.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.840
I was planning to take it

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.630
and then return it to you.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.800
Thanks for your kindness.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:16.530
Commander Qin.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.710
I like your ring.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.510
I'll give you five gold bars for it.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.200
It's not for sale.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.630
If you won't sell it,
I'll just keep following you.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.490
I'll die without the ring anyway.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.330
Then follow me if you must.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.070
If you're with me,

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.870
you won't die,

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.190
with or without the ring.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.710
You!

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.280
How about this, Miss Liu?

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.530
If you buy me a stick of candied hawthorn,

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:37.530
I'll give this ring...
