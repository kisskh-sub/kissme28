(This Zhao Rou did not come
with good intentions.)

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.259
(What exactly
is her purpose behind all this?)

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.619
(I need to find a way)

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.899
(to use force against force.)

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.699
Miss Mary, Ms. Li is busy right now.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.179
None of you is stopping me today.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.059
I want to see for myself
whether anyone still runs Tan Group at all.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.738
I already told you today.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.618
I must get this batch of goods.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:34.540
(Here comes the force.)

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:35.499
One day late,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.539
and my charity gala
cannot afford the delay.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.459
But your delivery cycle is next Friday.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.820
And you did not send us
an email in advance.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.379
Miss Mary.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.058
Your company's order

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.659
clearly states delivery is next Friday.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.578
What do you mean

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.658
by making a scene now?

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.018
What is written on the order

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.860
is the final delivery date.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:56.739
But. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.179
I need this batch today
to meet my performance target.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.579
Tan Group

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.019
cannot deliver it?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.539
What does Miss Mary take

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.259
Tan Group Design Department for?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.258
You may use
all your connections to ask around.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.939
If today even our Design Department

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.579
cannot deliver this,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.539
then I would like to see which company
in the market dares to take this order.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.780
What?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.899
Does Tan Group

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.459
not treat its diamond clients as gods?

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:23.939
Of course.

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.140
At any time,

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.939
Tan Group always puts
customer demands first.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.579
You are?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.659
I am the Vice Chairman of the Board.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.860
Zhao Rou.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.739
Hello.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.099
From today onward,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.659
my subordinate
will liaise with Miss Mary.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.140
Designer Li.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.980
Suspend all business activities.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.900
From today onward,
Miss Mary will not be seeing her again.

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.900
This way, please.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.579
Fine.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.859

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.659
=Episode 13=
That client just now

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.498
seems to be a diamond level VIP.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.099
It's fine. None of you need to get involved.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.920
Why don't you go and apologize,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.600
personally lead everyone
to work overtime and rush it?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.450
Even if it still can't be finished in time,
at least it saves face for them.

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.778
Otherwise, Vice Chairman Zhao
just took office,

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.379
and she'll probably
come after you first.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.179
(This is exactly what I was waiting for,
for her to light this fire.)

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.020
(So I won't be caught off guard.)

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.240
Why don't I apologize on your behalf?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.979
After all, they're our diamond VIP.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.618
Today the client
changed the schedule at will,

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:36.780
and we put up with it.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.760
Then tomorrow or the day after,
if they keep pushing

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.120
to cut Tan Group's design fees,
what are we supposed to do?

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.459
Endless concessions

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.859
will only make them push further,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.340
trampling over our bottom line.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.939
None of you need to interfere.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.790
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.060
Alright.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.058
Designer Li really does

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.020
take full responsibility alone.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.938
If I hadn't arrived in time today,

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.058
Tan Group would have

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.580
lost a diamond level VIP outright.

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:02.370
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)

00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:07.082
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.659
What does you mean by this?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.379
Is this killing one to warn a hundred,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.618
using me as an example?

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.379
Such a perfect opportunity,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.460
of course.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.139
I hereby announce

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.939
that Designer Li
has been dismissed by the company.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.580
I just spoke
with Miss Mary on the phone,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400
and she explained
the full background of the matter.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.259
Li Shujing.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.500
Effective today,

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:37.780
you are reassigned to the factory

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.500
to retrain and relearn operations.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.338
Designer Li has already been dismissed.
There is no need for her to go to the factory.

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:46.259
First,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.498
this is a compromise proposed
by Miss Mary.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.259
She suggested that Li Shujing

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.699
be sent to the factory
to correct her professional discipline.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.859
Second,

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.460
Tan Group

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:57.098
does not punish its own people

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.579
to appease a client.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.459
But Li Shujing...

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.859
Ms. Zhao, I think you have spent
too many years in the overseas division.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.020
You are back now, yet you
no longer protect your own people.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.220
Who would still be willing
to work for you like that?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.659
It seems

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.539
my record at Tan Group

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.600
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)
will need a few more lines added again.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.580
Clear all this junk

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.979
out of my sight.

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:33.745
I am sorry.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.099
This bag

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:40.380
is yours.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.619
Consider it a parting gift.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.940
Do not come in tomorrow.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.599
This cup

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.507
might as well be used
as Li Shujing's urn.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.499
If anyone touches
a single sheet of paper here again,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.739
I will have her clutch
her resignation letter

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.220
and walk into the incinerator.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.780
Mr. Tan,

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:07.780
why are you so angry?

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.979
You care so much about Li Shujing,

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.340
yet she does not seem grateful at all.

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.940
This has nothing to do
with Ms. Zhao, does it?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.499
It does not concern me.

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:20.738
But once Li Shujing

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:22.380
is sent to Chuangyang Factory,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.340
she becomes my responsibility.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.179
Tell me,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.499
will it be a production accident,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.260
or a falling load of steel?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.780
Then you had better pray she survives.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.299
Otherwise, I promise
every strand of your hair

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.340
will end up in the machines.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.259
You frightened me.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.700
Mr. Tan.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.419
I played along pretty well, didn't I?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.949
Designer Li,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.349
now that you have what you wanted,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.257
don't forget next spring's designs...

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.419
The New Spring Collection.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.778
Across the entire market,

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.299
I will work exclusively on your project.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.260
Designer Li is refreshingly decisive.

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.658
However,

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.499
there is one thing I am curious about.

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.580
A designer
with an overseas background like you,

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.859
why insist on going
to that rundown factory?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.499
Mr. Tan,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.380
you seem quite free lately.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.020
You even have time

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.738
to reminisce with me.

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:51.499
Ms. Zhao was thriving overseas.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.900
Why not stay on some island
enjoying the sunshine,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.700
and instead rush back home?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.580
As for me,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.179
a man with time to spare,

00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:01.939
I'm interested in buying in.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.940
I wonder
if Ms. Zhao would be interested.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.819
As for my appetite,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.099
it is quite large.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.979
I am willing to take on any game.

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:12.820
I just wonder

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:15.659
whether you have
any impressive leverage to offer.

00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:19.940
If Ms. Zhao returned

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.820
to push Tan Jianfei out,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.220
then my hand

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.260
is more than strong enough.

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:31.979
Right now the brothers are at odds.

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:33.699
But when the time comes,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.020
you will surely
band together for profit again.

00:07:36.837 --> 00:07:39.032
I am not playing along with that.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.299
(Still hoping to squeeze money
out of the overseas division.)

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:51.298
(Those overseas messes,)

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:52.819
(I still want you brothers)

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.619
(to hurry up and plug those holes.)

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.082
(Tan Group Textile Mill.
Fabric Dyeing Plant)

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.499
This side is done already.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.260
Spread that out more. Lay it flat.

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:37.738
Hello.

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:39.219
Are you Master Zhao?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.820
Doesn't this look a bit uneven?

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.339
Neither Chairman Tan
nor Young Chairman Tan showed up.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.458
Why did they send
an unfamiliar woman instead?

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.420
Probably just here to go
through the motions.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.259
The color of this batch of fabric

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.658
comes out differently every time.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:54.820
There is always
a color deviation from the sample.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.580
It is very hard
to pass customer inspection.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.339
Chuangyang Factory focuses
on handmade customization

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.099
and intangible heritage plant dyeing.

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.700
The oxidation time and condition of the dye
determine how the color develops.

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:16.538
With today's lighting,
temperature, and humidity,

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:18.779
the oxidation time should be extended
by two more minutes.

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.060
Humidity should be controlled
at fifty percent.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:23.240
Only then can you ensure
that every batch of fabric

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.940
comes out with consistent color.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:26.899
Are you sure?

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:30.698
If handmade intangible heritage fabrics
are to be produced steadily

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:31.820
for the market,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.658
relying solely on passed down experience

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:35.019
is simply not enough.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.940
You have to extract
scientific patterns from it.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.538
That will do.

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:16.538
Two dye immersions,

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:18.499
with oxidation time
and humidity properly controlled.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.779
This is the final product.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.540
The color looks perfect.

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:24.259
It matches the sample exactly.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.538
Do you still think I came here

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:27.899
just to go through the motions?

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.619
From today on,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.178
follow the oxidation schedule

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:33.940
I provided, strictly.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.940
For every shade lighter
in future bulk orders,

00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:39.340
one zero will be deducted
from your year end bonus.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.418
This young woman is impressive.

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:42.940
Yes, absolutely.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.298
(Such defective fabric...)

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:50.499
(Why does it look exactly like)

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.739
(the batch that got
my father convicted back then?)

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.379
(Coming to the fabric mill
was the right move.)

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.460
(What on earth is being hidden here?)

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.578
(I have to get to the bottom of it.)

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:04.139
(That batch of fabric back then,
who handled it before it became defective?)

00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:10.139
Finally done.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:17.979
How are you adjusting to the factory?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.099
I'm asking you now as the chairman.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.540
I'm doing just fine at the factory.

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:27.619
No need for you to worry, Mr. Tan.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:28.779
Is that all?

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.979
Your health isn't good.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.619
Traditional dyeing here
is heavy manual work.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.379
You really need to rest more.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.379
Mr. Tan has learned
how to care about people now?

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.940
When you burned that videotape,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.220
did you ever think I might suffocate?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.499
If I told you

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.099
I burned the tape to protect you,

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.779
could you believe me just once?

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.899
Zhao Rou suddenly parachuted in

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.259
and started targeting you here.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.538
I still haven't figured out

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:00.859
what she's really after.

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:02.578
You must stay alert.

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:03.460
Do you understand?

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:06.820
Are you afraid I'll see that videotape,

00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:09.619
take revenge on you,
and drag you down with me?

00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:13.339
If you're not prepared

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.220
to go to hell with me,

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.540
then stay away from me.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.220
Tan Jianfei,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.580
if you dare interfere
with my business again,

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.019
I'll rip out your heart

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:26.979
and make it kneel in repentance
at my father's grave.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.000
Then what were we before?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.779
A lapse you gave into
while still clear headed?

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:33.658
Did you ever once think

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.220
of standing shoulder
to shoulder with me?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.460
Tan Jianfei.

00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:38.619
This is my final warning to you.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.540
Stay away from me.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.859
The more you hide from me,

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:44.859
the more I will hate you.

00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:54.074
Shujing.

00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:54.932
