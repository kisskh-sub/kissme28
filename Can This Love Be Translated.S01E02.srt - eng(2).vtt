00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.063
Sir.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.859
Hello, sir. Good evening to you.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.444
Please allow me.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.031
Wow, that's a lot of luggage.
You must've been gone for a while.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.824
- Yes.
- I'll do it.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.785
I've been away for three months,
and it sure is warmer here.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.122
It's absolutely scorching.
As you'd expect this time of year.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.373
Please leave it.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.626
I guess he's a celebrity.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.545
Sir, take a look. There's a celebrity.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.799
I once drove a celebrity.
You know Lee Jung-jae from The Crooks?

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.509
- You know him, don't you?
- Yes.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.762
His son is a pretty good-looking guy.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.681
He went on about his son
becoming a singer or celebrity,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.810
but after seeing Lee Jung-jae,
I knew the kid didn't have the face.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.898
Have you ever seen a celebrity
in person, sir?

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.365
Bet you're wondering which scenes.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.618
I get it. It was a split second.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.245
I'm an unlucky actress
who's never seen success.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.289
Wanna bet?

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.291
If I win, you have to follow me.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.644
LOTS OF NEW EXPERIENCES
ON SET FOR THE QUIET WOMAN!

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:44.437
I guess she's filming a movie.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.864
CHEESE CATS I MET ON THE STREET

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:03.623
She posted my photo without permission?

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.252
"Papago." (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.254
"Grateful for you."

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.054
9,999 FOLLOWERS
FOLLOW

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.472
FOLLOWING

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.390
10,000 FOLLOWERS

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.641
10,000?

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.519
So I made it happen?

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.110
This is Papago.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.321
As per the terms of our bet,
I followed you.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.949
Sorry for the way I left that day.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:39.367
Good luck with filming.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.453
I hope your festival begins soon.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.625
Wow, they must be setting off
fireworks somewhere.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:50.295
I guess so.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.923
Maybe there's a festival somewhere.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.239
DO RA-MI, CHA MU-HEE

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.546
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.107
Hey, easy.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.734
Damn it.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.412
Do Ra-mi!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.103
Please give her a big round of applause.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.278
Please introduce yourself to the audience.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.241
Hello. I am Cha Mu-hee,
an actress from Korea.

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:53.181
Mu-hee. You were great out there.
Totally awesome!

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.098
What's wrong?

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.099
Take these off me.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.601
I really need the bathroom,

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.395
but I don't think I can pee
wearing a ring worth millions.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:02.565
Then what about your clothes?
They're Chanel.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.233
Oh, you're right!

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.028
Wow, I can't believe I sat on it.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.951
Mu-hee, you need to get used to this now.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.788
If they're Chanel, you're Do Ra-mi.
You can be rough with them.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.457
Yong-u.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.792
Is this all even real?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.922
Why do you say that?

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:29.300
Since waking up from my coma,
these past few weeks just don't feel real.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.677
I keep thinking I died back then…

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.349
and woke up in heaven.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.186
It's as good as heaven, is it?

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:44.398
I'm so happy I could explode.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.903
I'm so happy that, if it's all a lie,
I'd rather die than wake up.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.572
It's real.

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.325
You're Do Ra-mi, the superstar.

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.536
So go pee with that ring on.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.917
And you should upload a selfie
before you get changed, Ms. Do Ra-mi.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.586
Your fans are waiting.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.214
- Okay.
- Get some rest.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.810
I have over ten million followers.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.605
I didn't even have 10,000.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.356
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.242
What's the matter? Are you feeling unwell?

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:20.995
No.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.166
I'm fine. All good.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.093
I guess I got a little dizzy from nerves.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:42.975
I'm home.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.480
Mr. Kim has brought guests again.

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:49.607
Again?

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.819
This place is packed to the brim
with old books, paintings, and antiques.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.030
Just think of it as a museum.

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.491
Wow, this place sure is impressive.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.077
This is amazing.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.953
Very impressive.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:08.376
He published my first novel,
so we were pretty close.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:12.630
Back when he was alive,
this place was like my second home.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.674
Look around. Don't be shy.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.635
Hey, Ho-jin! Come over here.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:23.182
That's the grandson. His daughter's son.
He knows Mandarin, so watch what you say.

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.393
Well, hello.

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:27.144
- Say hi.
- Nice to meet you.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.855
They're professors
from a Taiwanese university.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.108
They'll be here a few days
to browse the books.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.445
See? I told you he'd be happy to see us.

00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:40.825
I'll take care of everything here,
so don't pay us any mind.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.577
- Mr. Kim.
- Give me a moment.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.996
Let me show you something really precious.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.748
Mr. Kim?

00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:51.419
So now you're planning
to use this place as a guesthouse?

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:56.090
You always leave it empty,
traveling the world to interpret.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.633
This is the next best thing.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.596
Your maternal grandfather
loved hosting guests,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.306
and I often helped look after them.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.685
Well, I own this house now,
and I don't like having guests.

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.772
Goodness.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.858
While I figured Mr. Yoon

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:17.194
might leave this place to his grandson,

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.989
I thought he'd at least leave me
these books.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.199
But he had to go
and leave them to his daughter.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.744
Your mother couldn't care less
about this stuff.

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.122
Since you're here,
please give my mother a call.

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:32.126
Tell her to please come pick up
all these books and things.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:35.171
How could she when she's abroad?

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.256
We can fill a container
and ship it to her.

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.217
Don't you dare. I'll report you
to the Korea Heritage Service

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.386
for smuggling
priceless cultural artifacts.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.181
Then what do you want from me?

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:48.058
I can't sell the house
thanks to all this stuff.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.977
Should I continue living here alone?

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.023
That's exactly why
I keep bringing guests over,

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.733
so you're not so lonely.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:02.907
In any case, please give my mother
a message from me. Okay?

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.994
To come to Korea and sell or donate
everything before the year ends.

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:11.081
Sure, but your mother
will have to come to Korea first.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.125
Hey, I found it!

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:17.129
Here it is.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.510
Then how about getting hitched?

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:23.511
Sorry?

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:27.348
She came back for her father's funeral.
Surely she'd come for her son's wedding.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.933
I can't get married on my own.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.017
True.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.353
You'd need a woman.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.439
Are you dating a celebrity, by any chance?

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.191
What do you mean?

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:41.445
The publisher's employee who came with us
to Japan asked me about it, all excited.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.156
She was wondering if you were traveling
with that actress, Do Ra-mi.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.535
She asked if it was you in this picture.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.577
Picture?

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.288
This one.

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.920
Stand still.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.382
I'm pretty sure it's you.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.760
Out with it.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:10.683
It's a meaningless photo,
and we weren't traveling together.

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:13.394
There's nothing more to it.
Please get that out of my face.

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:25.531
So it really isn't you in the photo
on Do Ra-mi's Instagram?

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:28.117
I already told you it isn't me.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.953
Even Shunji called me about it from Japan.

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.747
He asked,
"Are Hojin-san and Do Ra-mi dating?"

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.916
"Did they come to Japan together?"

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.629
I have never dated Do Ra-mi,
nor have we ever gone on a trip together.

00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:49.054
Don't tell people stuff like that.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.724
I'm not friends with Do Ra-mi, okay?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.852
Stop laughing, guys.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.605
He's an awful liar.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.028
What are you looking at?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.487
Does this

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:07.698
really look like me?

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:09.575
It's a side profile.

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.076
Yeah.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.495
Even the height and build.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.961
Strangers won't know it's you.
People who know you will.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.463
It's totally you.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.218
Anyone who knows me will know it's me?

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:41.357
Everyone, the New Year's countdown
is about to start!

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:52.159
This year, actress Cha Mu-hee is also here
at the midnight bell-ringing ceremony.

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.161
Wow, Do Ra-mi's ringing the bell?

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:58.040
Of course. Do Ra-mi's
absolutely everywhere these days.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.417
The actress who plays Do Ra-mi
is named Cha Mu-hee?

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:01.627
I didn't know.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.088
May all your wishes come true
in the new year.

00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:08.258
Nine, eight, seven, six,

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:11.345
five, four, three,

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:13.681
two, one!

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.094
Lovely.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.430
We're going for glamour and elegance.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.518
Okay.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.901
Mu-hee.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.695
The photos taken today

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.740
are for a special edition cover
in five Asian countries.

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:17.661
And journalists from Vogue Singapore
are here to interview you.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.457
If it's Singapore,
would the interview be in English?

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:24.043
I haven't done
many foreign press interviews.

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.086
Yes, the interview will be in English,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.672
but don't worry,
we have an interpreter here.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.340
Thank you.

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:41.060
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.320
"It's nice to meet you like this."

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:54.490
"Are you doing better now,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?"

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.760
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.514
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.307
"It's nice to meet you."

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:22.810
"Are you doing better now?"

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.398
Yes, I'm completely better now.

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:32.402
It's so nice to see you too.

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.200
Please tell her that.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.260
I've never been to Singapore before.

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:58.554
I've only seen it in YouTube videos.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:02.057
It seems like such a beautiful place,
and I'd love to go someday.

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.883
You posted photos
from your Japan trip on Instagram.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.428
Who is the man you're grateful for?
Your fans want to know.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:50.189
Right, that man.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:58.405
He was just someone I happened to meet
who kindly gave me directions.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.283
Just a guy who spoke fluent Japanese.

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.679
The hope was for something more romantic.

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:25.349
From your fans.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.313
He was just a guy

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.149
whom I happened to cross paths with.

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.155
But…

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:46.578
just the thought of a chance encounter

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.498
with someone charming while traveling…

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.504
is enough to give me butterflies.

00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:11.687
Sir.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:16.149
Right, where is Ms. Cha Mu-hee?
I need to talk to her about something.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:19.444
She asked me to bring you to her.
She's in the parking lot. Let's go.

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:22.322
I can say what I need to say here.
It won't take long.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.951
Sorry, we're running a little late.
You can chat with her on the way there.

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:28.537
No, Yong-u, I… It'd be really quick.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.248
- Mind your head.
- Sure.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.964
- Here.
- I'll just tell her next time--

00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:40.549
Come on, Mr. Joo.

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.469
Hop in.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.848
We don't have much time. Get in.

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.694
Sorry. I haven't had a chance
to eat lunch yet.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.322
Have you eaten yet?

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.198
I'm good.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.535
- You should finish your lunch.
- No, I'm done.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:13.248
Is that even enough food?
All I see is a salad.

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.835
I'm short on time these days,
so I eat like this in the van.

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.962
Besides, I get puffy
if I eat before a shoot.

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:23.884
I had no idea we'd meet again like this.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:27.012
- I was so surprised to see you earlier.
- Sorry if I startled you.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:31.058
I wanted to meet you,
but it wasn't exactly easy.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.770
So I asked a fellow interpreter
for a favor.

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:41.276
You took the interpretation gig today
on purpose to meet me?

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:42.861
Yes.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:48.575
Why?

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.202
Well, the thing is…

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.707
There is something
I really need to tell you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.459
We're here.

00:23:00.128 --> 00:23:02.381
My next gig was just next door.

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:05.175
It's close, but we have a lot of stuff,
so we drove over.

00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:07.677
- Then I'll just say it right here.
- Sure.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:11.223
The day we met in Kamakura, Japan,

00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:12.140
you--

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:17.020
- Let's go. We're late.
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee is here.

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:20.524
Sorry, the interview went long,
so I'm running late.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:22.901
It'll take about two hours.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.154
Would you mind waiting?

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:29.324
- I'm sorry we're so late. Just one moment.
- You're 40 minutes late.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.742
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:31.660
I'll wait.

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.995
Yes, we'll head right up
to the green room.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.958
It's Jun Hyun-moo's talk show.
I'll tell my manager, so stay and watch.

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:43.922
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:58.103
Mu-hee will enter from there.
You can watch from here.

00:23:58.186 --> 00:23:59.354
Sure, thanks.

00:24:02.732 --> 00:24:03.942
Hello, Producer Yeong-hun.

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.820
That day is… Mr. Joo, excuse me.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:09.990
I don't think that day will work.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.242
Yong-u, where are you?

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:17.747
Yong-u, did you show Mr. Joo Ho-jin in?

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:20.041
Yong--

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.502
He's never there when I need him.

00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:25.839
Mu-hee, who was that guy
in the van with you earlier?

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.341
He interpreted your interview, didn't he?

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:33.889
A while ago, I met him briefly in Japan.

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:38.810
When I heard his voice behind me,
I thought my heart was going to burst.

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:41.771
No wonder.

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:45.567
I thought you had a funny look
on your face earlier.

00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:48.487
I thought of him from time to time.

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:51.114
I even thought about seeking him out.

00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:54.201
Meeting him like this gave me butterflies.

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:57.412
Maybe work was an excuse,
and he actually came to see you.

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.580
No way.

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:03.043
He was really good-looking
and had a nice voice too.

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.504
His eyes creased in a smile,
he flashed his dimples,

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.422
and was all, "Ms. Cha Mu-hee."

00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:10.425
He's so smart and a real gentleman too.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:15.013
Is that right? What on earth happened
between the two of you in Japan?

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:17.224
Seriously, nothing happened.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:19.518
- Why else would he be here?
- I said no!

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.646
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- Seriously, calm down.

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:24.689
Maybe you should calm down.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:26.358
Why are your cheeks so flushed?

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.610
It's just hot in here.

00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:30.445
Your cheeks are on fire.

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:33.698
She woke up
to find herself a global superstar.

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:38.036
Today's guest is actress Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
better known as Do Ra-mi. Welcome.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.372
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.832
You're in such high demand lately.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:44.376
Thanks for joining me today.

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:46.378
- Thank you for having me.
- Of course.

00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:49.923
You became a global sensation overnight.

00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:51.508
Does everyone recognize you now?

00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.844
Not as much as you might expect.

00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:58.348
I think people have a hard time
recognizing me

00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:01.268
because the Do Ra-mi makeup
was very dramatic.

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:04.396
Is that so? Maybe you should wear
a full face of white powder.

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:06.189
That's interesting though.

00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:08.817
I thought lots of people
would recognize you, but I see.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.027
And we can't not discuss this.

00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:14.364
You suffered a fall
during the filming of that movie.

00:26:14.447 --> 00:26:15.365
How did that happen?

00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:18.451
On the last day of filming,
we were shooting the very last scene

00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:21.329
when the stunt wire malfunctioned,
and I fell.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.790
I was in a coma for about six months,

00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.459
but to me, it just felt like waking up.

00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.878
Like coming out of a deep sleep.

00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:32.048
But when I woke up,
so many things were different

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:34.175
and so much had changed, so…

00:27:06.082 --> 00:27:07.083
Excuse me.

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:17.594
Excuse me. Where is Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:27:17.677 --> 00:27:20.639
The shoot's over now,
so I guess she must have left?

00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:24.684
She left?

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.821
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee?
- Let's get out of here.

00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:48.583
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It must've been boring.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.043
No, it was fun.

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.338
I didn't expect so many people on set.

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:55.465
There are even more for dramas and movies.

00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:00.845
By the way, is it okay for you
to walk around like this?

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.809
People don't really recognize
Cha Mu-hee yet.

00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:07.977
They only recognize me
if I say I'm "Do Ra-mi."

00:28:09.562 --> 00:28:11.815
Aren't you cold? That coat looks thin.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.818
This is from a new line,
not even in stores yet.

00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:19.030
They sent it to me specially in advance,
so I should wear it, even if I freeze.

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:21.032
Right, marketing.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.867
Like a walking mannequin.

00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:26.162
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.292
You must be tired.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.962
We should keep it short
so you can get home.

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:36.131
Yes, and I'm starving.

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.716
Let's go grab some food.

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:40.719
Some food?

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:47.976
That day, I said I'd eat with you,
but we never got around to it.

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.729
I'll eat with you today to make up for it.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.402
All right. I felt bad
for leaving you like that,

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.070
so it's on me.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:10.957
I know a place nearby.
The walk will be cold, so wear this.

00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:14.669
Thank you.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.643
To welcome our very special guest,

00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:35.732
this bottle of wine from Italy,
my homeland, is on the house.

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:38.193
No, we're good. We won't be drinking.

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:41.654
We're leaving right after dinner.

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.740
But I appreciate the gesture.

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:45.867
If you say so.

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:48.995
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:55.668
Are you a lightweight, Mr. Joo?

00:29:57.086 --> 00:29:58.421
No, I can hold my liquor.

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.883
I wouldn't want to waste your time
when you're exhausted.

00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:04.844
You can hear me out over dinner.

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:11.810
Right, you said you came
to tell me something.

00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:13.937
What is it?

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.065
You posted photos from your Japan trip
on Instagram, didn't you?

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.276
Yes, I did.

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:23.655
You saw me post them on Instagram then.

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:26.241
Please delete the photo you posted of me.

00:30:27.742 --> 00:30:28.576
Sorry?

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:32.664
The photo mentioned
during the interview earlier.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:34.541
Please delete it.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.674
So you're telling me

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:46.970
you took on that interpreting gig

00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:50.598
just to ask me
to delete that photo on Instagram?

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.350
Yes.

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:55.061
I had no other way of meeting you.

00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.192
Then why didn't you ask me
right after the interview?

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.028
I intended to,

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.447
but you were too busy.

00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:10.451
I thought

00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:13.329
this would be a much deeper conversation.

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:18.668
I didn't think you'd come here
over a measly photo.

00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:22.297
Okay, I'm sorry for coming to see you
over a measly photo.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:26.342
Why would you post a photo of me
without my permission?

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:29.512
Your face isn't even in it properly.

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:32.849
You were right there,
and that reporter didn't recognize you.

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:34.851
Everyone who knows me can recognize me.

00:31:34.934 --> 00:31:36.686
It's led to so many… Where did he go?

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:38.146
…unnecessary misunderstandings.

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:41.566
Delete it in front of me right now.

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:44.944
Fine.

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:49.407
I'll delete it,
considering how you came to see me.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.376
But will you be okay?

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:01.878
Okay with what?

00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:05.548
Look.

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.677
This post has a million likes
and 60,000 comments.

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.596
If I suddenly delete it now,

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:14.599
those unnecessary misunderstandings
would gain meaning.

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.648
Did you say you rarely use Instagram?

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:24.776
You don't know the world of social media.

00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:28.363
Deleting and unfollowing speak volumes.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.572
Deleted post? A breakup.

00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:32.033
People would totally think
we were a thing.

00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:39.749
Does that mean I'd be the man you dumped
after your big break?

00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:44.045
You said anyone who knows you
can tell it's you.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:45.964
It'd be embarrassing.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.510
But if you're okay with being
the man Do Ra-mi erased--

00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:52.679
Hang on. Let me give it some thought.

00:32:56.766 --> 00:33:03.272
You can't change the date…
you uploaded the post.

00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.108
Can you?

00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:13.491
Are you dumb?

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.201
Of course not.

00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:25.420
Is it because of the date?

00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:31.134
Thanks to the photo
you posted, without thinking,

00:33:31.634 --> 00:33:34.595
someone could find out
I was there that day.

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.514
I don't want that.

00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:39.767
Is that someone

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:42.812
the woman whose birthday it was?

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.564
But you went to see her.

00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:50.111
Didn't you meet?

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:51.863
I decided not to.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.033
You ran off like that and changed nothing?

00:33:57.243 --> 00:33:58.244
I guess not.

00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:01.414
I'm the same person I always was.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.005
What a waste.

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:11.424
You even gave up that fancy meal.

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:20.892
You've changed a lot, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:24.395
I'm glad. It's nice to see.

00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:28.816
It seems like you're enjoying
a festival of your own, like you said.

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:32.403
Thanks.

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:40.620
In any case, it's your fault
we didn't get to eat that meal then,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.747
so you can pay for tonight.

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.466
Thanks for dinner.

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:58.429
My van's coming. Do you want a ride?

00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:00.098
No, I live close by.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:02.100
And I prefer to walk when I can.

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:03.518
Good night, then.

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.794
Can I have that back?
You won't be cold in your van.

00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:31.587
I'll be walking, so…

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:33.589
Right.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:49.438
Did you really come to see me
because of that photo?

00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:52.567
The photo could have been an excuse.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.027
After my big break,
maybe you wanted to say hi

00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:57.572
or were curious to see me again.
Something like that.

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:00.241
I guess you could think of it that way.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.870
It is a bit tiring, being famous.

00:36:03.953 --> 00:36:06.873
Getting calls from childhood friends
I don't remember.

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:11.085
Even an old landlady of mine
reached out to me out of the blue.

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.630
I did wonder about you,
though we only crossed paths once.

00:36:16.632 --> 00:36:17.842
I get it.

00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:22.138
Think it over and tell me
what to do about the photo.

00:36:22.638 --> 00:36:25.141
Wait, you don't have
my contact info, do you?

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.560
Would you like my number?

00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:29.687
I'll contact you through him.

00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:35.693
Please answer my calls.
I called and texted multiple times,

00:36:36.402 --> 00:36:37.945
but you're unreachable.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.781
Sorry. I have your card,
but I never saved your number.

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.742
I don't take calls from unknown numbers.

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:44.452
Please save my number and answer.

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:48.581
I'll think about how to handle it
and reach out through him.

00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:51.292
I'll be going, then.

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:52.710
Goodbye.

00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.047
You know Mr. Joo?

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.716
Yes. He visited you in the hospital.

00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:01.260
He visited me in the hospital?

00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:05.056
- Yeah. He came two or three times.
- When?

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.183
When you were in the eight-person room.

00:37:07.975 --> 00:37:09.644
I was in an eight-person room?

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.480
Wasn't I in a private room
in the VIP ward?

00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:18.110
Actually, before you blew up as Do Ra-mi,
you were in a shared room with eight beds.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.198
After the accident, insurance covered
the hospital and caregiver fees,

00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:26.118
but the studio and agency argued over
who'd be liable if you didn't wake up,

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:27.578
both threatening to sue.

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.205
It was a complete mess.

00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:32.625
I was planning on quitting myself
if you never woke up.

00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:35.169
I'd even forgotten
about his business card.

00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:38.714
Here. Mr. Joo's business card.

00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.601
How did he know to come?

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.938
There were some articles
about what happened on set.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:56.023
He said he'd read one of them.

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.609
Despite the coverage,

00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:01.404
people lost interest quickly,
and there was no follow-up.

00:38:02.488 --> 00:38:06.784
I assumed he came because he had no way
of knowing if you were still alive.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.079
I figured you two were close.

00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.248
No.

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.792
I'd only met him once before.

00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:21.257
I'm glad. It's nice to see.

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:26.387
I did wonder about you,
though we only crossed paths once.

00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:36.564
Sure, I'll look for it
and call you back. Bye.

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:42.570
Where did I put it?

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.577
Give it meaning, huh?

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.580
The man who got dumped.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:18.022
Just the thought of a chance encounter
with someone charming while traveling

00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:22.026
is enough to give me butterflies.

00:39:32.912 --> 00:39:35.706
Thank you for coming along and helping me.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.208
Sure.

00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:39.043
And thank you too.

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.629
They say this talisman
reunites the connected.

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:45.383
If you and I are connected,
I'm sure we'll meet again someday.

00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:49.678
Yeah, I'm almost there.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:53.557
Come on. Who is this person
you want to introduce me to?

00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:32.346
Ji-sun!

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:38.936
- Why do you look so nice today?
- Do I look okay?

00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:41.564
Ho-jin, you're here!

00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:03.210
If I save his number, he'll show up
on my suggested friends on Instagram.

00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:06.213
If I keep digging…

00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:10.050
maybe I'll find her.

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:11.802
Find who?

00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.763
Just some woman
whose birthday is on April 8th.

00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:20.102
I want to see how amazing this woman is
to have a man that smart and capable

00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.688
wrapped around her finger.

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:26.942
Why? Did that woman
run off with Mr. Joo's money?

00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:28.611
"Mr. Joo"?

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:32.907
I always address
loyal people respectfully.

00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:35.201
A sign of admiration.

00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:37.453
Then why do you call me Mu-hee
and not Ms. Cha?

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:39.914
That's a sign of our closeness.

00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:43.042
Speaking of, he texted me.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:45.961
He wants you to erase it.

00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:50.007
- That's all? He didn't say anything else?
- No.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:54.595
Please let Ms. Cha Mu-hee know
I've decided I'd rather be erased.

00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:58.015
So once I delete it, it's over.

00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:18.619
She deleted it.

00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.762
MR. JOO HO-JIN

00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:39.848
Is her condition worse after moving rooms?

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:41.559
I'm worried.

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:46.647
I saw that Ms. Cha was moved
to a different room. Is she better now?

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:54.113
Why did he have to be so kind?

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:56.991
Makes him harder to erase.

00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:06.625
Shoot, I ended up memorizing his number.

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:11.046
Now I really won't be able to forget.

00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:57.217
Hello?

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.145
Hello? This is Cha Mu-hee.

00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:09.229
Yes, hello.

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:13.400
I called to let you know
that I deleted the photo.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:14.735
Yes, I saw.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.947
So you saw.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.450
That was quick.

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:29.667
The reason I called you is…

00:44:32.711 --> 00:44:35.464
I just found out about something
I didn't know before.

00:44:35.964 --> 00:44:37.800
I thought I should say thank you.

00:44:37.883 --> 00:44:39.385
Jackpot! I found her, Mu-hee.

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:43.097
The woman whose birthday is April 8th.
Just needed a little Instagram digging.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.391
But she's Producer Shin Ji-sun!

00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:47.935
She's famous. You know her, right?

00:44:48.977 --> 00:44:50.062
Hey, what…

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:01.281
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, I…

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.161
Did you happen to hear that?

00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.580
You went out of your way to look her up?

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.146
I was worried

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:36.525
that you might get the wrong idea
and think I'm a psycho stalker,

00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:40.320
so I came to meet you in person
and explain myself.

00:45:41.697 --> 00:45:43.699
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:44.908
So how'd you find her?

00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:53.417
Social media is a place where people
publicly leak their personal information,

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.379
so it was an easy find
through your friends' comments.

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:02.718
You found her by snooping through
a total stranger's social network?

00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:05.721
That's some curiosity you've got.

00:46:08.682 --> 00:46:09.600
Well,

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.770
if you put it that way,

00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:15.397
it was very nosy of me.

00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:18.192
I apologize.

00:46:19.693 --> 00:46:22.154
Now you know her name,
you must be curious about more.

00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:29.161
To be honest,
I'm feeling really embarrassed and cold,

00:46:30.162 --> 00:46:32.873
so I'd like to promise
to stop being curious about her

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:36.043
and hop into that warm van,

00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:42.549
but I honestly can't guarantee
I won't snoop through her Instagram.

00:46:43.258 --> 00:46:45.344
I know I'm being nosy,

00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:47.137
but I just want to know.

00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:52.100
Whatever.

00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:56.063
I'm the one who shared that story
with you, a total stranger.

00:46:57.272 --> 00:46:59.608
You're not entirely to blame
for being curious.

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:01.485
You should go.

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.153
But you were also

00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:06.824
curious about the well-being
of a total stranger.

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:13.372
You wanted to know if I was okay
while I lay in that hospital bed.

00:47:15.874 --> 00:47:17.334
I was…

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.797
so grateful to you for that.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.762
The reason I called earlier

00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:33.350
was actually to thank you
for worrying about me.

00:47:35.602 --> 00:47:39.439
But thanks to my nosiness,
I only ended up apologizing.

00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:42.943
You should head in.

00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:45.445
As for her Instagram account,

00:47:46.321 --> 00:47:50.200
I'll try my best not to look at it.

00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:53.495
I don't believe you.

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:56.582
I know exactly
how obsessed you are with Instagram.

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.585
Then what?
Should I delete my account right here?

00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:01.545
Can you? With ten million followers?

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:08.844
Then tell me the whole story yourself
so I don't have to snoop.

00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:13.015
And don't ask why
I'm so curious about you.

00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:16.852
I'd rather not reveal the reason
for my curiosity out here in the street.

00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:30.866
Let's talk inside.

00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:36.830
Let's satisfy your unexplainable curiosity
somewhere warm.

00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:05.275
You've been curious
since you walked in, so I'll explain.

00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:07.235
This is my house.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:09.571
I inherited it from my grandfather.

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:13.450
A place this big--

00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:16.703
Let's not go as far as to ask
how much it costs or just how big it is.

00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:22.125
Why would I ask such shallow questions?
This place is clearly fancy.

00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:27.130
How warm.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.929
Do you like coffee?

00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:37.683
I might shoot a coffee ad soon.
Shall I send you some free samples?

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:40.477
No. Once the ad is out,
I'll see it and buy some.

00:49:42.688 --> 00:49:44.606
Do you have any nieces or nephews?

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.818
Young kids are obsessed with Do Ra-mi.
I could sign some posters.

00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:49.319
I'm afraid I'm an only child.

00:49:50.028 --> 00:49:52.781
Right, so you don't have
any nieces or nephews.

00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:54.616
That's too bad.

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:00.872
I have Do Ra-mi merch too.

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:03.291
- Do your parents not like Do Ra-mi?
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.502
I know. I'm blabbing
because this is so awkward.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.257
Now that I'm inside,
I don't really know what to say.

00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:17.264
You said the idea of a chance encounter
while traveling gives you butterflies.

00:50:19.474 --> 00:50:21.393
I met her while traveling.

00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.230
On that island where we met?

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:29.109
We promised to meet again,
but never managed to,

00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:32.863
and I thought that was the end of it
until I ran into her again.

00:50:32.946 --> 00:50:36.074
As the girlfriend of someone
very close to me.

00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:42.706
So that woman doesn't know
you still have feelings for her?

00:50:43.665 --> 00:50:45.709
No, she doesn't.
Because I hid them from her.

00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:51.381
So if you'd met her again

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.802
on that island on her birthday,

00:50:57.262 --> 00:50:58.889
everything would've changed, right?

00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:03.977
It's a pretty pathetic "what if,"

00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:05.812
but perhaps.

00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:18.742
Then, Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:22.412
if, on that day,

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:26.833
we had had that meal together
instead of separating at the train tracks…

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.713
might things have changed…

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.468
between us too?

00:51:51.858 --> 00:51:56.071
The day I met you,
I hadn't gone to that island by chance.

00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:01.118
Every year since she asked
for that island as a birthday gift,

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.328
I have gone there every year.

00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:09.793
She never found out, and I have
no intention of ever letting her find out,

00:52:10.585 --> 00:52:11.711
but on that day,

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:13.922
I wanted to let my feelings be.

00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:14.840
Just for a day.

00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:19.177
That's why you insisted
I delete that photo.

00:52:21.763 --> 00:52:23.390
To you, that photo

00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:27.686
may simply have captured
the memories you made while on a trip,

00:52:28.436 --> 00:52:30.981
but to me, it's a moment
no one can find out about.

00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:37.946
So, on that day,

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.117
even if we hadn't gone our separate ways
and had spent more time together,

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:46.705
nothing would have changed between us.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.373
That is my answer.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.838
Right.

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.465
I see.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.555
After digging on Instagram,

00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.725
I guess I dug up
a tearjerker romance movie.

00:53:09.936 --> 00:53:11.396
And I'm not cast in it.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.576
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:32.918
Don't be mistaken. I'm not crying.
My nose is just running.

00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:34.252
Right, your nose.

00:53:35.503 --> 00:53:39.132
My nose is running because I came in
from the cold. I'm not crying.

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:41.051
- I get it.
- Why is my nose running?

00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:42.052
Here.

00:53:43.845 --> 00:53:45.472
How embarrassing.

00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:31.101
Here's a garbage can…

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:38.775
It's okay. I don't want
to leave behind this snotty tissue.

00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:43.613
And I say this because I don't want
to leave any misunderstandings,

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:47.659
but the reason I said all that stuff
about curiosity and train tracks

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.912
is because I just wanted
to check something.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:51.997
Check? Check what?

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:55.208
What I wanted to know

00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:59.129
was whether you perhaps
had feelings for me.

00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:00.422
I was worried. That's all.

00:55:02.173 --> 00:55:03.049
Me?

00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:05.343
You know my embarrassing past.

00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:08.805
What if you use that to threaten me
into going out with you?

00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:10.473
It's a legitimate concern.

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.142
I am a celebrity.

00:55:15.603 --> 00:55:17.230
Well, as you know,

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:21.234
I just made it big, so I can't exactly
date or be in a relationship right now.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.444
You understand, right?

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.114
Oh, I see.

00:55:26.948 --> 00:55:31.703
So you're telling me that I'm the one
who should be doing the understanding?

00:55:35.373 --> 00:55:36.291
Look.

00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:38.626
I will never…

00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:42.547
ask you to

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.674
go out

00:55:45.258 --> 00:55:46.384
with me.

00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:49.304
No matter the threat.

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.265
And let me also apologize.

00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:55.101
If I made you worry
by appearing out of nowhere.

00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.187
I'm sorry.

00:55:58.146 --> 00:56:00.440
We will never see each other
like this again.

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.402
Does that reassure you?

00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:13.078
The threat thing…

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:18.041
it just came out, like my runny nose.

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:22.545
They're just meaningless words
blurted out of embarrassment.

00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:23.463
I'm sorry.

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:29.552
You said there's no embarrassment
with someone you'll never see again.

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:35.183
Besides, I told you my secret too.

00:56:36.601 --> 00:56:40.647
We each shared a secret,
so let's leave it at that. Call it even.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.194
Thanks for letting us call it even.

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.408
So,

00:56:52.784 --> 00:56:55.662
we'll never see each other again, will we?

00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:02.293
All right.

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.088
I'll be going.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.259
Take care, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:16.808
I won't ask you out,

00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:18.810
but can I still root for you?

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:27.527
Your long-awaited festival
has finally begun.

00:57:28.695 --> 00:57:29.737
Congratulations.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.991
I'll watch from afar and cheer you on.

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:36.828
Thank you.

00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:52.177
An umbrella.

00:57:56.181 --> 00:57:59.267
We'll never see each other again, will we?

00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:20.955
It's okay.

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.791
Once I close my eyes and reopen them,

00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.669
these feelings will go away too.

00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:49.067
The red carpet
at the Tokyo International Film Festival

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:54.197
will soon welcome actors and actresses
from around the world

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.823
who gave incredible performances.

00:58:56.783 --> 00:58:58.076
And as we speak,

00:58:58.159 --> 00:59:02.580
Cha Mu-hee, who took the world by storm
this year as Do Ra-mi in The Quiet Woman,

00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:07.085
has arrived on the red carpet.

00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:16.135
Mu-hee-chan!

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:56.861
Wake up.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.376
I'll help you.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:21.594
Let's walk together.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.364
Before the conference begins tomorrow,

01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:44.534
there will be a brief meeting
for the professors.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.453
Please interpret at that meeting too.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.581
Sure. I'll meet you in the lobby
tomorrow morning.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.334
- Thanks for your hard work today.
- Good night.

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:21.863
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.586
What are you doing here?

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.840
What happened?

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.386
Mr. Joo Ho-jin,
there's something wrong with me.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.057
I think I'm going crazy.

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:56.814
I think…

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.819
my festival is about to end.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.922
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:46.150
