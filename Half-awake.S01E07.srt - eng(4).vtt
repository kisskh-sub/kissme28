=Episode 7=

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.040
Yeah.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.280
Never thought it'd actually be you.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.100
So this is that 'other way'
you talked about?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.400
We clearly don't share the same path.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.680
If you can't accept it,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.280
then hand over the captain's spot.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.680
I don't even care

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.440
to get involved with people like you.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.120
I'm telling you officially now,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.320
I'm out. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
Xiao Yinan,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.160
a sophomore at Donghua University,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.690
the captain of the e-sports team.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.400
His sister,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.920
also your close friend,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.160
is Xiao Qianyu.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.080
What a terrible wine.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.840
You actually drink it.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.080
You did that on purpose.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.520
You want to see us turn
against each other.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
Otherwise, how could he

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.800
get in here so easily?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.600
You reunite after a long separation.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.240
I just gave him a chance

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.600
to see who you really are.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.960
When you went to his school,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.760
you were dressed so neatly.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.120
If I didn't let him come over,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.840
how would he ever know

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.880
the real you behind the image?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.760
To win someone over, to win their heart.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.240
If you want to reach your goal,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.160
you need a little strategy.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000
When his emotions

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.720
start falling under your control,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320
that's when you've won.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.400
You went through all this trouble,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040
just to set up those college students.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.480
What?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.800
Are you jealous?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.800
Is he capable of that?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.160
Let me warn you.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.440
You and everyone around you,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.920
I could take them all down

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.200
without breaking a sweat.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.600
Gu Yixiao,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480
I've told you before,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.960
my body and my heart

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.680
are all yours.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.840
No one else can get close to me.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.520
Of course,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.440
except you.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.200
So,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.280
keep those people away from me.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.200
Relax,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.360
I'm not walking away from you.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.720
Ye Xingwan,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.120
don't take yourself seriously.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.280
(Gu Yixiao,)

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.600
(the real show's about to start.)

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.320
Miss Ye,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.880
you were looking for me?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.240
I want to ask you something.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.540
Haven't I already told you everything

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.480
you want to know?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.200
What else do you want to know?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.600
Besides his likes and habits,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.880
does he have any special dates?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.920
Special dates?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.680
Yeah.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.080
Dates that really matter to him.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.320
She took the blame

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.600
to protect Xiao Yinan.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.620
There is definitely something
between them.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.500
You've been paying

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.690
extra attention to her lately.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640
Didn't you tell me
to keep an eye on her?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.680
I'm just telling you the truth.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.680
You can't really trust women,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.960
especially her.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.840
After all these years,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.400
you've seen with your own eyes

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.100
how she set traps
for so many shareholders,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.160
making them hand over shares
for nothing.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.840
And now?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840
She's completely flipped the script,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.240
clinging to you to be your woman.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.960
Who knows what she's really up to?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.080
Don't forget,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.160
your dad lost his life
because of a woman.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.160
Don't make the same mistake again

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.520
and ruin everything we've built.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.160
All her tricks,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.320
I taught her myself.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.640
I know exactly what she's capable of.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.040
No need to keep reminding me.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.720
Spread the word

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.560
that I'll go to another city tonight

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.040
to discuss a business deal.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.240
Alright.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.480
(Dad's birthday,)

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.600
(Mom's birthday,)

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.240
(Dad's memorial day,)

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.640
(his birthday...)

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.440
(Which one would he use
as the password?)

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.080
(If I tried them all...)

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.740
(Xiao Qianyu)

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.000
Hello? Qianyu.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.240
Could you do me a favor?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400
I didn't expect

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.380
the reason why you become
Mr. Gu's secretary

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.560
is that Mr. Ye owes him money.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.200
I know I shouldn't drag you into this.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.920
But aside from you,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.240
I really don't know

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.840
who else I can trust.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.440
What are you talking about?

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.360
What are you planning?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.280
Gu Yixiao isn't in Haishi tonight.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.880
I want to take this chance

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.160
to check his computer.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.920
If we find anything on him,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.560
we might both get out of this.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.320
No way.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.440
That's way too risky.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.160
I heard

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.400
one of his guys once lost some files.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.160
He pushed him until he lost his mind.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.120
If he catches you, it's over.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.400
Relax.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.720
Since I moved in there,

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.360
he hasn't come back once.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.950
Plus,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.760
he's heading to Luancheng tonight.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.360
Xingwan,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.640
we just call the police.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.600
No, we can't.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.760
We've got no evidence if we call now.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.760
Just follow my lead.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.880
I'll blow the fuse tonight.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.000
But he's way too suspicious.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.560
If he notices the cameras are out,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.760
he might rush back.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.200
So I need you to stand guard downstairs.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.120
Once you spot Gu Yixiao's car,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.640
call me right away.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.720
Alright?

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840
Xingwan.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.280
Please.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.950
Hello?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.930
Your house's power is out
due to a circuit issue.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.760
The manager says it's a circuit problem.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.680
Should he go up and check?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.320
No need.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.130
Turn around and head back.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.640
Got it.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.220

(What could it be?)

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.000
