WEBVTT

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.107
I've really wanted to try this.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.943
Is that right?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.125
I swear it's delicious.
What's "delicious" in Japanese again?

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.297
- Oishi.
- "Oishi."

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.725
Delicious, isn't it?

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.894
I told you.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.352
Hiro, come on!

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.124
Cha Mu-hee is doing great.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.460
Despite all his grumbling,
she's trying to see the best in him.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.212
You're right.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.840
She giggles at whatever Hiro says.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:15.510
Nothing he's saying
strikes me as particularly funny.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:19.055
If that's her playing to the cameras,
Cha Mu-hee is a brilliant actress.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.438
Was the hot dog that good?

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.152
I've worked with you for over five years,

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:35.530
but today's the first time
I've seen you polish off junk food.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.949
I know, right?

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.910
I downed that whole mountain of calories.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.790
I was just copying her "delicious,"
but ended up finishing the whole thing.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.209
If you enjoy the food,
the calories don't count.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.502
Just look at it that way.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.840
That woman's a bit strange, you know.
She's always smiling.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.802
Even when I act cold and distant,
she keeps smiling.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.345
God knows what's so amusing.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.475
And she gives me stuff like this.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.937
She's up to something.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.898
You reckon?

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.859
It looked like she was
genuinely enjoying herself.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.527
Genuinely enjoying herself?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.030
- With me?
- Yes.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:20.116
It looked like she was on a date
with a guy she likes.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.787
In moments like that,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.665
there's something different
about a woman's smile.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.500
I guess you could say it glows.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:31.961
She was glowing?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.506
Because of me?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.409
Four-leaf clover?

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.253
Won't her legs fall asleep like that?

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:19.944
Yes, she found one.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.499
She's so happy.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.675
So how was today?

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.262
You seemed to be in a good mood
during your date.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.556
I had such a good time.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:52.560
We ate delicious food
and took some silly photos.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.314
My favorite moment was seeing
the sunset on the hill.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.736
It's getting pretty chilly.

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.446
Aren't you cold?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.240
I'm pretty good at braving
the cold and the heat.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.992
I'm not cold at all right now.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.042
I've never really liked sunsets
because they make me feel a little sad.

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.004
But today, I like it. It's beautiful.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.927
What's different about today?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.474
I guess being alone made me feel lonely.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.019
Maybe I like it now
because we're together.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.399
Out of all the sunsets I've ever seen,

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.403
I think today's is the most beautiful.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.242
Then I guess you'll remember
this moment forever.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:03.714
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.008
Going forward,

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.053
will Producer Park conduct our interviews
instead of Producer Kim?

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.930
Producer Kim isn't here.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.391
He took a flight back to Korea.

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:14.308
Sorry? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.228
He flew back due to a family emergency.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.523
Is it something serious?

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.649
Not at all.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.362
It's personal, so I won't go into detail,
but it's nothing to worry about.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.532
But the rest of the crew doesn't know.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.785
They're rushing to find and send over
a new producer,

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.621
so let's keep this between us
until they get here.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.292
So we won't be filming
until the new producer gets here?

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.794
Yes, tomorrow's shoot is canceled.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.673
Wait, then what about seeing
the Northern Lights?

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:47.758
That won't be canceled, will it?

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:52.680
The Northern Lights are the highlight
of our Canada shoot, so of course not!

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:55.516
Right? We came here to see the lights.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.517
- Of course!
- Right.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.186
There's no guarantee we'll see them.

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.191
At this time of year,
the probability is about 60%.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.527
With tomorrow canceled,
the Northern Lights shoot is only one day,

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:07.987
so our odds have halved.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.114
We'll barely get a glimpse if we're lucky.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.532
- Barely?
- Yes.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.285
No, come on. Luck will be on our side.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:17.371
We'll get to see the lights. Come on.

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.749
- What?
- Way to stay positive.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:23.586
What now?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.713
I'd say 30% is still decent.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.510
With the Northern Lights,
it could go either way.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.678
Best to just leave it to fate.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:37.350
But he said it's barely likely.
I really wanted to see them together.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.312
Get some rest
since there's no shoot tomorrow.

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.481
What are you talking about?

00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:46.317
Since there's no shoot tomorrow,
we should drink up.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.028
Bring me some of your soju and ramyeon.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.157
Why pair soju with instant noodles?
I have a lot of good food in my room.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.992
Come on. Let's drink in my room.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.869
But drinking in that room…

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.790
Sure, why not?

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:05.836
Wait! Let me change into something
more comfortable.

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.466
I'm just going over to drink soju.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.141
It's not like I'm going for a run.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.109
Does this look like I'm going clubbing?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.988
How come I have nothing to wear?

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:46.877
Come in.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.382
The soju is in the fridge.

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:53.301
Okay.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.399
Why don't you ask Mr. Joo Ho-jin
to join us?

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.860
Is he in his room?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.361
Mr. Joo's not here.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:13.779
He's not?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.907
He went to a bookstore
he'd been meaning to check out.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.619
It amazes me
that he's read all those books,

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.996
and it astonishes me
that he went out to buy more.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.420
That's how Mr. Joo Ho-jin is.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:33.007
He even reads tourist pamphlets
in different languages.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.218
How should I cook the squid?

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.262
Let's go with medium rare.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.209
KIM YOUNG-HWAN

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:09.126
Congratulations.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.254
Your book seems to be a bestseller
here in Canada too.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:13.964
I guess you'll be rich.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.734
I heard this is a must-try in Canada.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.779
I really wanted to try these hot dogs.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.979
It really is good.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.121
So his eyesight isn't that bad.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.545
This one's in Korean.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.758
Are you a fun read?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.521
You're back, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:54.482
Yes.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.156
I had a few drinks with Yong-u
since we're not shooting tomorrow.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:03.657
We cleaned up after ourselves.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.994
He goes out like a light when he's drunk.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:08.662
Just leave him be.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.131
Well then,

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.466
I'll get back

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.259
to my room.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:24.762
Good night.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.402
Those were definitely my glasses.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.865
Why was he staring at me so intently?

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.784
Was he sorry to see me go?

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.704
Then why not invite me to stay
and have another drink or something?

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:51.789
Seriously.

00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.296
- Ms. Cha?
- Idiot.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.548
Yes?

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.299
You left your cell phone.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.676
Right, thank you.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.094
And please leave my glasses.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.682
Oh dear, sorry about that.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:13.561
I was so absorbed in that book
that I left wearing them.

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.813
I borrowed them
because I have bad eyesight.

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:19.567
They're the perfect prescription.
I didn't even realize I had them on.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.652
They're just protective glasses.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.825
I see. So you have good eyesight.

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:30.703
They look a bit bent.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.295
If you liked it, I can lend you that book.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.255
I guess it would be

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:44.383
less embarrassing to say
I'll borrow it, wouldn't it?

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.469
Sure, lend it to me.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.763
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.565
My key card.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.905
I don't think I brought it with me.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.878
The concierge isn't in right now.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:25.591
Yong-u isn't waking up either.
He's always been like this.

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:29.094
I'll find a way inside.
You should go and sleep.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.222
You're going to stay out here?

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.934
There's a couch down the hallway.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:39.647
That guy. I'm sure he'll wake up
if I wait for an hour or two.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.359
Okay, I'll keep calling him too.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.534
My key.

00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.039
I left mine inside too.

00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:00.584
Don't even joke about that.
It's not funny.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.127
Seriously.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.473
You're going to stay here?
Won't you be cold?

00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:16.725
I'll be okay.

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.186
You should go to Ms. Cho's room.

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:21.271
I'll be going, then.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.758
I think I'd better stick around here too.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:54.304
Yong-u will be up in an hour or two,
and I'd feel bad waking Ms. Cho.

00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:05.232
If I'm honest,
I wasn't reading that novel.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:06.608
What's it about?

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:16.076
It's a mystery novel,
and I hear it'll be adapted into a movie.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.163
Sounds like a super fun read!

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:21.081
Yes, it's pretty good.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:25.461
A murder took place,
but it turns out there's no murderer.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.881
Why would you spoil the ending?
That's bad manners.

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.382
Will you read it?

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:33.802
Keep going.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:38.432
It's set in a peaceful,
crime-free rural village.

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:43.312
An ordinary young man
commits a petty crime,

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:47.149
which leads to him being ostracized
by everyone else in the village.

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:50.736
One day, he's beaten to death
by the widow who lives next door.

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.615
They need to find out her motive,
so they examine each of the villagers…

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:56.992
Suddenly!

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.455
- Then…
- I didn't even flinch.

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:03.665
Really? So you just pretended
to be startled?

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.134
- You're lying.
- I swear.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.594
I bet you just made that up.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.508
You're awake.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.177
I must have dozed off.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.888
What about Yong-u? Is he awake?

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.307
Did you drop by your room?

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:03.892
Not yet.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:08.021
- I'll go try waking him up.
- Shall we go to the farmers market?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.235
I thought I'd go.
Do you want to come with me?

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.655
I do. Let's go together.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.945
Mr. Joo, carrots.

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.321
What did that lady say earlier?

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.366
In the West,
walking under a ladder is taboo.

00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:44.284
They believe it's bad luck.

00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:47.621
Really? I had no idea. What should I do?

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:52.793
Maybe I should sprinkle some salt.
I believe in that stuff, you know.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:56.171
Yeah, I thought you might.
I saw you looking for four-leaf clovers.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:58.548
You did?

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.510
I'm collecting them
so I can see the Northern Lights.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:05.931
They say one needs luck
to be able to see them.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.518
So four-leaf clovers for luck,
and I need a lucky seven of them.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.603
My goal is to find seven.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.065
But I've only found five so far.

00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:19.820
If I can't find seven,
we might not see them.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:26.285
Okay, so if we don't get to see
the Northern Lights, it's all your fault.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:30.622
Do you really have to be so harsh?

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:35.502
Why? You were beating yourself up,
blaming yourself for everything.

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.045
I simply agreed.

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:42.217
In moments like this,
you should empathize, not agree.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.929
Comfort me by saying,
"No, why would that be your fault?"

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:49.808
Or say, "I'm sure
you'll find the remaining two."

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.436
Some words of encouragement.

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.064
An aurora happens

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.860
when charged particles from space
collide with the Earth's atmosphere

00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:02.696
and lights up the sky.

00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:05.949
It does not correlate
with four-leaf clovers whatsoever.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.200
That's me comforting you.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:08.785
And

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:10.996
good luck finding two more.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.498
There's some encouragement.

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.631
I get it.
You don't believe in this stuff, do you?

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:22.549
I figured as much.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:24.259
Strictly speaking,

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:28.472
I'd say I don't waste energy
worrying about what might happen.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.225
It's only natural to feel anxious
when things might not work out.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.811
Still, though,

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.981
you go in with an inkling of hope
that they just might.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:44.237
Is that not your mindset
when you start something, Mr. Joo?

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:49.159
What I mean is…

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:54.623
I'm going to find all seven
and show you the Northern Lights,

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.416
so have faith and look forward to it.

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.588
Sure, I'll look forward to it.

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:07.844
KIM YOUNG-HWAN

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:11.223
For real?
If you're just saying that, I'll be hurt.

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:13.517
This deadline is killing me.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.852
Send me a pic or something.

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:17.896
This is why
he should've started writing sooner.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:19.815
What is it?

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:25.570
Turns out, even a literary giant
eyeing the Nobel Prize in Literature

00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:28.490
needs a little comfort and encouragement.

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:32.285
Five minutes, huh?

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:35.414
Head to the car with your things.
I'll be right behind you.

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:38.268
He said he'd be quick.

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:41.521
Why isn't he coming?

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:46.693
Yes, hello?

00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:49.237
I was lost, but I know where I am now.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.238
Two more blocks and…

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.948
Are you lost again?

00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:56.328
You locked yourself out,
and you're bad with directions.

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:58.997
You can be a bit of an airhead sometimes.

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:03.376
Well, given the situation I'm in now,
I can't exactly deny that.

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:06.505
What do you see around you?

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.593
I'm near Calgary Tower.

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:14.888
Then wait by the tower,
and don't you fear.

00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:16.932
I'll come find you, kid.

00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:19.267
"Kid"?

00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:26.149
Oh, it's this way.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.388
Joo Ho-jin!

00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:06.481
So it really is you.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.024
Shin Ji-sun?

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.485
I saw you and followed,
thinking, "No way it's you."

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.529
What are the odds of meeting you here?

00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:17.534
I'm a little shocked.
What are you doing here?

00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:19.786
I came to help in Jeong-su's absence.

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.413
I just landed.

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.374
So you're the producer replacing him?

00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:25.375
Yeah.

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.879
This is perfect. Did you drive here?
I need to go meet with Ms. Cho.

00:26:30.463 --> 00:26:31.339
Yeah.

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.303
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:51.818
Hello, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.
I'm Shin Ji-sun, the new producer.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.574
Hello, I'm Cha Mu-hee.

00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:00.827
Glad to be working with you.

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.041
They've confirmed a new producer.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:08.960
She's a well-known producer in Korea
with several hit shows,

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:11.713
and she coproduced
the Korean season of Romantic Trip.

00:27:12.213 --> 00:27:14.299
A female producer named Shin Ji-sun.

00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:16.384
And the shoot? Are we starting right away?

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:20.972
Shooting starts tomorrow,
which means you have today off.

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:23.183
I'd better work out all day,
then hit the sauna.

00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:27.270
I got fat from nibbling
alongside that zombie.

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:33.902
It is true
that you gain weight very easily.

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:38.156
Tell her you don't eat much
because you're afraid of gaining weight.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:41.242
I don't want to reveal my weakness
to that zombie.

00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.121
By the way,

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:49.459
did it really seem that way
to you, Nanami?

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.629
It doesn't look like
you've gained much, no.

00:27:52.712 --> 00:27:54.714
- I'm talking about Cha Mu-hee.
- Cha Mu-hee?

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:58.468
Did my comment
about her liking you bother you?

00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:01.137
No, it's not that. I'm just worried.

00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:04.724
I think I'd better keep my distance
and treat her with more indifference.

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:07.477
Yes, for her sake.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:17.028
The cold hit me
as soon as I left the airport.

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.949
I stopped the taxi
to buy some warmer clothes

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:22.575
when I happened to spot you.

00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:24.202
What are the chances?

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.789
It gets pretty cold at night.
Let me know if I can get you anything.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:32.752
I had to pack and fly over in a hurry,
so I'm missing a lot of things.

00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:35.922
I'm so glad you're here, Ho-jin.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.427
What were you two doing there
so early in the morning?

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:44.389
We were just buying some groceries.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.558
Groceries?

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:50.520
You're buying groceries and cooking
while you're here?

00:28:51.354 --> 00:28:54.774
Joo Ho-jin.
As picky and diligent as always.

00:28:56.776 --> 00:28:59.821
Then, Mu-hee,
you must've tried Ho-jin's cooking.

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:00.739
Good, isn't it?

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.077
I wouldn't know.

00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:07.495
I've never tried it.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.289
Ask him to cook for you sometime.

00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.540
He's a great cook.

00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:15.879
All this food talk is making me hungry.
How long until we get to the hotel?

00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:18.131
About 30 minutes.

00:29:18.214 --> 00:29:20.133
Should we stop at a restaurant nearby?

00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:22.510
It's fine. I'll eat once we get there.

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.806
Walking under that ladder

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.475
really was bad luck.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.107
You must be pretty bummed.
You were having such a great time too.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.236
What a pity.

00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:46.117
You even lied to spend time
with the person you liked.

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:49.621
In your pocket.

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:51.498
Our room key.

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:08.056
You should ask her
what you're dying to know.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.184
Why are you here
and not preparing for your wedding?

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.572
Hey, lady, what are you doing here?

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.407
What about your wedding?

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.368
The wedding. Your wedding!

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.209
What about your wedding?

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:38.503
Sorry?

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.093
I heard your wedding is next week,
so how come you're here in Canada?

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.221
Right, about that.

00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:53.184
They urgently needed someone here,
and I was the only one available,

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.978
so I came for now.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.026
I was told that Hiro is staying
at a hotel downtown.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.863
This is good. I can go say hello now.

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.832
I called my manager,
so he'll be here shortly.

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:18.001
You two go on ahead. You have work to do.

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:21.588
We should've dropped you off first.

00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:24.549
Sorry about that.
We'll see you back at the hotel.

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:27.010
Ho-jin, let's go.

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:32.849
Hey.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:36.853
You should take this.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.190
You can keep it on. I'm fine.

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:45.945
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:49.532
You ran away, and she followed you here.

00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.619
Did you really not know she was coming?

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:55.204
I didn't know.

00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:02.545
I don't want to wear it. Go.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.194
Think he really didn't know?

00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:30.281
He said he didn't.

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:34.911
His "I didn't know" wasn't followed
by any comfort or encouragement.

00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:38.831
Just goes to show you're nothing to him.

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.218
Has the work been fun so far?
How have the shoots been?

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:53.388
Your wedding is next week.
Is it really okay for you to be here?

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.931
Is everything prepared?

00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:57.475
What's there for us to prepare?

00:32:57.558 --> 00:32:59.602
All that's left to do is the ceremony.

00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:01.187
What did Jin-suk say?

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:04.774
He didn't have any complaints
about you coming here?

00:33:04.857 --> 00:33:06.275
You know Jin-suk.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.736
He goes along with whatever I say.

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.571
Why would he complain?

00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:14.492
Let's just get it over and done with.

00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:19.622
If we don't tie the knot right now,
I don't think I'll ever want to.

00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:30.717
Why do you… want to get married?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.759
Why?

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:33.511
You said you wanted to.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:45.064
Forget it. Just thinking about work
is enough to give me a headache.

00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.568
In any case, I guess we're colleagues now.

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:52.113
I look forward to working with you,
Mr. Joo.

00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:57.076
Nanami, who works with Hiro,
speaks decent Korean.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.871
If there are any issues,
you can address them with her first.

00:34:00.663 --> 00:34:01.497
Sure.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.208
Let's head up.

00:34:05.668 --> 00:34:07.462
Ms. Cho, I'm at the hotel.

00:34:27.023 --> 00:34:28.441
Just one to go now.

00:34:49.545 --> 00:34:50.546
It's the zombie.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:01.057
What are you doing here?

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.102
Everyone's up there waiting to see you.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.772
What are you doing here?
Why'd you come here?

00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:11.109
Meeting. Your meeting.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.571
There are people there waiting.

00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:16.489
Now waiting.

00:35:17.907 --> 00:35:19.992
Meeting? You came to meet me?

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.246
You were waiting for me?

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.877
What's he saying?
I can't understand a word.

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.087
Look.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.549
We're colleagues who only meet for work.

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.425
You can't crash my day off like this.

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:38.845
That's too much.

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:41.806
He seems like he's in a really bad mood.

00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:50.064
I'm not in a good mood today either,

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:51.899
so just go.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:26.851
You know how we're going to see
the lights tomorrow?

00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:31.147
They say in order to see them…

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.942
you need luck.

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.617
So I worked really hard to collect these.

00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:47.663
I really wanted to see the Northern Lights

00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:50.333
with the guy I like.

00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.088
But…

00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:03.554
the woman he likes is here now.

00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:10.978
If I collect all this good luck
and the aurora appears…

00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:20.988
I bet he'll go see it
with the woman he likes.

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.749
So now, I hope…

00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:35.962
the aurora isn't visible.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:44.553
It's really important for our shoot…

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.312
but I'm praying it'll be ruined.

00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:01.362
Sorry.

00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:11.080
I'd better go now.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.042
Thanks for listening to me.

00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:18.838
Arigato.

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.395
I have absolutely no clue.

00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:39.150
What could she be so sad about?

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:53.414
Hello, I'm Shin Ji-sun,
here to fill in for Jeong-su.

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:54.957
Glad to be working with you all.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:39:01.547
Shin Ji-sun!

00:39:02.715 --> 00:39:07.136
Okay, everyone. Our most important shoot
with the Northern Lights is tomorrow.

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:10.556
According to the forecast,
the weather will be excellent,

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:13.184
and it will be
this year's strongest aurora.

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.854
Let's all see the Northern Lights
together tomorrow!

00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:20.900
Northern Lights!

00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:23.444
- Let's go!
- Northern Lights!

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.821
Northern Lights!

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:28.366
Northern Lights!

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:29.283
Cheers!

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.786
What's Hiro doing?
Why didn't you come together?

00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:37.208
Right about now,
he's probably doing his evening workout.

00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:42.088
Aurora.

00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:43.923
Clover.

00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:46.592
I'm sorry.

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:48.761
Thank you.

00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.767
It's really bothering me.

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.479
Aurora.

00:39:59.313 --> 00:40:00.147
Clover.

00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:01.941
I'm sorry.

00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:04.151
Ho-jin, have some meat.

00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:07.780
- Eat up, Mr. Joo.
- Sure.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.116
Thank you.

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:11.826
By the way,

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:15.663
I heard that Producer Shin
is marrying your older brother.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:18.416
That makes her… your sister-in-law, right?

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:21.335
Ho-jin and I go way back,
so we just call each other by name.

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:24.130
Did you say you were having
a small wedding in Jeju?

00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:26.841
Then, to get to Korea and fly out to Jeju,

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.593
you'd have to be back
at least two days before the wedding.

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:32.138
So once Ji-sun leaves,
who will replace her?

00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:35.558
I'll be here for the entire Canada shoot.

00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:43.607
It's literally a small wedding.

00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:46.902
It'll just be our families there,
so we can push it back a week or two.

00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:49.447
Oh, you're pushing it back?

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.282
Well, that's perfect!

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:54.285
If the wedding happens
when we're back in Korea,

00:40:54.368 --> 00:40:55.703
then we could all attend.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.997
And the groom's brother can attend.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.415
How perfect is that?

00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:02.877
Wait, so you're delaying your wedding
to fill in for another producer?

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.920
Ji-sun, you sure are ambitious.

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.673
How can you possibly like one person
for so long?

00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:09.633
That's incredible, in a sense.

00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:13.262
You once asked
if I was in some passionate romance movie.

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:17.725
But my romance isn't passionate.
It's more terrifying.

00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:20.811
If I had to pick a genre, it'd be horror.

00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:22.229
Horror?

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.484
The same genre you'd find Do Ra-mi in?

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.153
I think, "It's over at last."

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:32.698
"It's finally dead,"
only to find it's still alive.

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:37.077
I run away, thinking, "I really want to be
done with it," but it keeps chasing me.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:41.373
Like a zombie that keeps coming for you,
no matter how many times you kill it.

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:44.710
I keep telling myself,
"I need to end this,"

00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:46.378
but I just can't.

00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:48.589
That does sound

00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:50.299
pretty scary.

00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:51.884
It sure is scary.

00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:56.514
I hope that this time,
I can get away once and for all

00:41:57.264 --> 00:41:58.516
and not get caught.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.104
Why, that Na Jin-suk!
Can you believe that punk?

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.649
After giving it much thought,
I agreed to officiate,

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:10.694
only for him to send me a single text
saying the ceremony had been postponed.

00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:11.946
Sorry, Mr. Kim.

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:15.324
And you still haven't heard from him?

00:42:15.407 --> 00:42:16.492
I haven't.

00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:18.494
Wait, it's nighttime over there, isn't it?

00:42:18.577 --> 00:42:21.622
I got upset and ended up
bugging you for no reason.

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:23.249
Sorry. Get some sleep.

00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:25.501
Okay, I'll speak to you soon, Mr. Kim.

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:26.919
Goodbye.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.996
Why's he moping like that
when she's totally fine?

00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:05.541
I can't bear to watch.

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.309
You thought
the wedding would end things for good.

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.727
This must be a headache.

00:43:26.145 --> 00:43:29.356
Did she tell you why she's here?
Did they argue?

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.026
Did you ask her?

00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:35.529
I didn't ask her,
but I think something happened.

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:38.532
But I'm sure it'll pass eventually.

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:43.537
Ji-sun is the only person who can control
and accept my free-spirited brother.

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:46.957
Right.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.919
So she's a really good person.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.634
Would their marriage really end things?
You'd be family and still see her around.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:58.677
What if the truth comes out one day?

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:02.389
Considering the situation, you might want
to come clean before the wedding.

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:06.310
Wouldn't that be the safer, smarter thing
to do, both legally and morally?

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.688
Are you comforting
and encouraging me right now?

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.941
I don't appreciate it,
so please stay out of it.

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:18.238
I just feel bad that you got caught
while trying to get away.

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:21.575
Then stop getting in my way and move aside
so I can make my escape.

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:26.038
Why are you trying to run off alone?

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.540
Why not grab onto someone nearby
to avoid her?

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.001
Hold onto someone and use them as cover.

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:33.545
Maybe they'll protect you.
You said you were scared.

00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.464
Do you really think I haven't tried?

00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:43.972
Can you please move aside?

00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:47.226
Unless you're asking me
to use you as cover.

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:53.691
You're so mean.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.611
I hope that zombie-like crush of yours
eats you alive.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.904
That jerk.

00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:46.118
I'm so embarrassed.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.787
He rejected me again.

00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:30.722
NA JIN-SUK

00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:13.932
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:15.893
With these three cameras,

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:19.187
let's get one full shot
and two close-ups of Hiro and Mu-hee.

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.273
Double-check the chairs and the positions.

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:28.030
Looks like it'll snow.

00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:32.242
I don't think
we'll get to see the Northern Lights.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.370
Well, it is what it is.

00:48:37.497 --> 00:48:39.458
I'm hoping for heavy snow.

00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:44.963
Mu-hee.

00:48:45.047 --> 00:48:48.258
Nanami will be interpreting for us today.

00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:50.469
Why?

00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:53.138
Did Mr. Joo refuse to interpret?

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:56.642
No, the car Ho-jin was in
got into an accident on the way here.

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:59.561
- Sorry?
- An accident?

00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:00.562
Was he hurt?

00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:01.855
No, no one's hurt.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.607
It was just a fender bender,

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.276
but it looks like
it'll take them a while to get here.

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:10.238
For today's shoot, we'll have to make do
with Nanami interpreting.

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:16.411
A fender bender? I hope he's okay.

00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:21.583
Mu-hee, don't worry too much.

00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:23.001
She said he wasn't hurt.

00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:24.461
I'll try calling him now.

00:49:25.003 --> 00:49:26.463
It must be my fault.

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.883
I prayed for everything to be ruined.

00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.512
I should never have said that.

00:49:39.184 --> 00:49:40.978
All right, let's start the shoot.

00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:43.522
- Okay.
- Okay, let's start the shoot.

00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:44.523
Nanami.

00:49:44.606 --> 00:49:47.109
Please just help them
understand one another.

00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:48.944
I mean, yes.

00:50:03.458 --> 00:50:05.711
The weather isn't good.

00:50:14.052 --> 00:50:17.222
He says it looks like it's going to snow.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.108
Snow.

00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:35.240
It does look like it's going to snow.

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.339
All right,
that's a wrap for today's shoot.

00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:54.134
So we didn't get to see the lights.

00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:56.803
They sure like playing hard to get.

00:50:57.345 --> 00:51:00.766
Why don't we try waiting
for just one more hour?

00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:02.559
It's such a shame.

00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:04.102
Hey, we can't, okay?

00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:06.855
It's 1:00 a.m., and the sky's grim.
There's no chance.

00:51:06.938 --> 00:51:08.273
Our crew will get sick.

00:51:08.356 --> 00:51:09.691
It's gotten too late.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.070
Once you're all packed up,
please head to the lodge nearby.

00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:14.905
But we came all this way.

00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:16.198
This is so disappointing.

00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.868
I'll stay behind and film the lights
if they're visible early in the morning.

00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:21.369
We can use it as stock footage.

00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:30.462
Are you also disappointed
that we didn't see the lights?

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:32.631
No, glowing.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.637
You said that she glowed
when she was with me.

00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:43.517
Are you okay?

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.185
You sure are ambitious.

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:48.730
Yeah, I'm super ambitious.
I'm going to blow up and become famous.

00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.065
Sure you will.

00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.567
But she seemed different today.

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.697
Probably because
my interpreting fell short.

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.199
Your interpreting?

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.242
Yes.

00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:03.495
I guess I failed to convey
your words accurately.

00:52:04.996 --> 00:52:06.248
Ms. Cha Mu-hee

00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:11.128
always heard you talk to her
through somebody else.

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.424
You're right.

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:19.302
She always heard someone else in her ear.

00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:30.564
So it wasn't me?

00:52:37.028 --> 00:52:38.530
PAPAGO♥

00:52:38.613 --> 00:52:42.409
I heard you were in an accident.
I've been so worried. Are you okay?

00:52:51.459 --> 00:52:55.297
Please message me back,
no matter how late. I'll stay up and wait.

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:15.025
Let me know when you get back.

00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:29.247
Producer Shin, late-night snack… delivery.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.418
Did she go somewhere?

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:40.759
NA JIN-SUK

00:53:40.842 --> 00:53:41.676
Hey, Ji-sun.

00:53:42.844 --> 00:53:44.638
Please don't hang up on me. I'm sorry.

00:53:45.138 --> 00:53:47.057
Let's get married like we planned.

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:49.059
Please don't say we're over.

00:53:53.438 --> 00:53:54.356
You heard that?

00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:58.276
Don't you dare tell a soul.

00:53:58.777 --> 00:54:00.487
If you do, I'll kill you.

00:54:11.957 --> 00:54:13.416
I just got back.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.752
If you're still awake,
do you want to come outside?

00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:26.179
Mr. Joo Ho-jin!

00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:33.186
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:37.565
I'm fine. I just got back late
because someone else in the car was hurt.

00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:41.152
I'm so sorry.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:43.363
For what?

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:45.907
For cursing you.

00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:49.077
I danced with Do Ra-mi all night
and cursed you out.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.247
The accident feels like my fault.

00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:54.666
I've felt so awful.

00:54:55.583 --> 00:55:00.338
The accident was the fault of the driver
behind us, who failed to look ahead.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:03.633
So your cursing and swearing
have nothing to do with it.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.056
However, the good luck you collected
came through.

00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:13.810
Can't you see it?

00:55:48.428 --> 00:55:51.139
Thank you.
I'm seeing the lights thanks to you.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.727
I'd like to take credit for this,

00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:58.980
but I threw out
all the clovers I collected.

00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:02.025
My wish had nothing to do with this.

00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:04.235
That's not true.

00:56:04.986 --> 00:56:06.237
You still have one left.

00:56:13.328 --> 00:56:16.539
You kept it all this time
instead of throwing it out?

00:56:16.623 --> 00:56:20.168
I saw how hard you worked to find them.
How could I just throw it out?

00:56:28.009 --> 00:56:32.514
Then we're seeing the lights now
because I wished so hard to see them.

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:34.557
I also helped

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:36.351
with one.

00:56:42.273 --> 00:56:43.983
You found one too?

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:46.277
I noticed it
while the accident was being sorted.

00:56:48.113 --> 00:56:49.489
I wanted to see them too.

00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.995
Our wish came true.

00:56:57.163 --> 00:56:58.665
It's nice seeing them together.

00:57:01.626 --> 00:57:03.711
What a view.

00:57:14.347 --> 00:57:16.349
Should we head in? It's late. We should.

00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:18.143
Why? Let's stay a little longer.

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:22.772
We've been staring at it for ages.

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:25.692
Well…

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:31.197
It's so rare to witness an aurora.
Who knows when we'll see one again?

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.533
We should keep staring
until we're sick of it.

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:50.425
She had hers?

00:58:11.696 --> 00:58:13.948
Let's stay together a little while longer.

00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:16.910
Let's do that.

00:58:18.745 --> 00:58:20.872
When else will we get to see this? Right?

00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:29.297
You know, Mr. Joo Ho-jin,

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.382
I heard a story somewhere

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:35.512
about a woman
who patiently taught her boyfriend,

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.431
who was dreadful with chopsticks,
how to use them properly.

00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:40.225
Then she told him,

00:58:40.308 --> 00:58:41.434
"If we ever break up,

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.729
every time you pick up
a pair of chopsticks, you'll think of me."

00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:47.357
And she was right.

00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.319
That's some effective
and scary brainwashing.

00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:55.949
We're seeing the aurora now
because I wished for it.

00:58:56.991 --> 00:58:58.660
So from now on, Mr. Joo,

00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:02.789
every time you see an aurora,
you'll think of Cha Mu-hee.

00:59:12.465 --> 00:59:13.967
Don't be scared.

00:59:14.842 --> 00:59:17.345
Auroras don't show up in Korea.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.181
Isn't that a relief?

00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:54.841
Oh boy.

00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:57.051
I think one just might.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.267
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:32.712
A three-leaf clover.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.757
Man, this isn't easy.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.345
Let's see.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.891
Hey, a four-leaf clover!

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.354
Carl!

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:50.813
A four-leaf clover.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:16.167
