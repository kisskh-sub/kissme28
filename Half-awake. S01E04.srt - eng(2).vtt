=Episode 4=

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.440
Where have you been all these years?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.940
Why did you give up going to college?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.480
How could I even face you?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.800
My dad ran off after borrowing money,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920
causing your family to lose everything.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.280
Qianyu,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.880
you're the one
I can never face in this world.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.440
Are you serious?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.720
Your dad who owed the money,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.720
not you. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.360
Do you know

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.320
that I've been looking for you
all these years?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.920
Does it even make a difference?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.120
My dad's debt

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.280
still has to be paid by someone.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880
When did you start smoking?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840
What exactly have you been doing?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.800
Just look at yourself now.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.200
Qianyu,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.770
the boss wants to meet you right away.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.560
Alright, got it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.800
I'll call you in a bit.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.640
OK.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.880
Xiao Qianyu was born in the same year,
month, and time as you, right?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.960
What do you mean by that?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.760
It's all her bad luck,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.560
being born on the same day as you.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.280
Where's Xu Dashan?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.080
Mr. Gu told us not to say anything.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.140
(Gu Yixiao)

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.260
Gu Yixiao,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.620
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.550
Aren't you supposed
to stick to your principles?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.880
Then let your best friend go.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400
I remember you telling me once

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.320
you two share everything.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.280
Even

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.120
you'd give up your life for each other.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.720
You let me know it on purpose.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.600
I just want to see

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.680
how deep things run between you two

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.800
and how much it would hurt you.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.720
Gu Yixiao,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.120
I'm begging you.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.960
Please, don't hurt Qianyu.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.880
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.160
Too late, Ye Xingwan.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.360
I already told you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.200
there's always a price for disobedience.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.800
Gu Yixiao! Gu Yixiao!

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.420
I'm secretary to Gu Yixiao.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.990
I can still make your life difficult

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.800
in the future.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960
Hurry up and tell me

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.200
where Xu Dashan went.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080
Say it! Where did Xu Dashan go?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.920
Room 1305.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.400
Miss Ye.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.080
Miss Ye, you know Mr. Gu well.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.240
- Step aside.
- Miss Ye.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.120
You should just leave.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.040
I'll take the blame.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880
Xingwan, what are you doing here?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.120
Go now, Xingwan!

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.800
Mr. Xu,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.840
don't you want me?

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.440
Let me do it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.840
Xingwan.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.840
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.040
How could you...

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.680
Did they threaten you or something?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.600
Xiao Qianyu,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.400
don't be so full of yourself.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.400
Right now, I only care
about money and power.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
I'm willing to risk everything for it.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440
You'd better not get in my way.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.280
No.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.960
In the past, you...

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.220
You said that was in the past.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.360
People change over time.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.200
And, Xiao Qianyu,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.300
if you want to be friends with me,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
take a good look at yourself now.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.760
Get her out of here.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.360
Xingwan.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.000
Xingwan!

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.440
(Qianyu,)

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.360
(I can't let you get hurt again.)

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.000
(Gu Yixiao,)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800
(I'm betting myself on you.)

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.660
(Gu Yixiao)

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.480
Gu Yixiao,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.840
are you happy now?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.560
Where are you going?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.080
We've been fishing Xu Dashan
for six months.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360
Are you giving it up because of a woman?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.930
Is she really worth it?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.840
Miss Ye,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.970
you sober up.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.840
Cut the talk.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.200
Let's start.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.240
Who is it?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.200
Yixiao,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.280
stop it.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.000
He could die if you keep going.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.680
The master made
quite an accurate prediction.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.630
A bloodshed misfortune

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.920
happened so fast.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.800
Guess you don't need any ritual now.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.780
Put your clothes on and come out.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.080
(You lost.)

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.360
Gu Yixiao.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.040
You still care about me, don't you?

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.740
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come to save me.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.680
Don't flatter yourself.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.440
I just can't stand anyone who defies me.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.120
You let Qianyu take my place.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.480
Was that just to make me suffer

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240
and let me beg you?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.360
What a pity.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.440
Seems I've disappointed you.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.560
Ye Xingwan,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.860
don't think I don't know
what you are thinking.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.320
You used Xu Dashan to test my limits.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.700
Let me tell you something.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.640
Even if Xu Dashan succeeds today,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.080
I won't have a shred of pity for you.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.920
Even if I had to hand you over
to Xu Dashan myself,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.760
I could still do it.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.000
Next time,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.420
if you act without my permission,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.640
and move on your own,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.600
you won't be that lucky again.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.080
Gu Yixiao.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.080
Tell me why.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.600
Why do you hate me so much?

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.280
(You really don't remember anything?)

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.080
I remember the moment I first saw you,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.400
my dad ran away,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.600
my mom passed away,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.720
and I dropped out of school.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.400
What did I do

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.740
that makes you despise me so much?

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.600
Ye Xingwan,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.760
everyone has to pay the price

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.760
for what they've done.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.400
(Yeah.)

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.880
(Everyone should face the cost
of their own actions.)

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.120
(Gu Yixiao,)

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.550
(I'm going to get close
to your inner circle,)

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.360
(gather solid proof of your crimes,)

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.440
(and bring you to justice.)

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.040
Xingwan, Xingwan.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.160
Are you OK?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.000
Did Xu Dashan do anything to you?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.560
I'm sorry, Qianyu, I'm so sorry.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.480
It's fine.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.040
Just now, I…

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.080
I saw you walking out with Mr. Gu.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.680
Was it him who saved you?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.600
Yeah.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.360
Gu Yixiao saved me.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.840
He helped me out.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.200
It was all over.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.480
Qianyu,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.960
you've got it wrong.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.040
Everything

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.520
has only just begun.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.880
Do you resent her for not listening

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.080
or hate yourself for losing control?

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.080
I'm exhausted.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:56.420
(Chengdong Police Station)

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.360
Gu Yixiao.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880
It's fine now.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.960
Go pick up your bag and the flour later.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.480
Fl... flour?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.210
Come on, let's collect your stuff.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.320
Sir, please help my dad.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.800
He's the only family I have left.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
- He's...
- Wu.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.760
- Captain.
- We just got a report.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.000
At Pier 5, near the containers,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.040
they found a man's body.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.200
Seems like he just died not long ago.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.760
Got it.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.880
What did you just say
happened to your dad?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.920
Gu Yixiao.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.320
Gu Yixiao,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.400
I want to be your woman.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.160
I want to be with you.

♪You betrayed me so decisively♪

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.630
