=Episode 10=

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.569
One hundred and fifty million.

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:32.223
This deal

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:33.723
must not be closed by Song Pai.

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:36.377
Do you have a plan?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.915
Mother, take a look at this.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.492
All the signed photos
of the First Prince are gone.

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:47.030
There will be even bigger surprises
next livestream.

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.607
What are you implying?

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:51.877
If something happens
to the First Princess,

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:55.530
do you think the First Prince
can still focus on business?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.539
BFO Tipsy Series Valentine's
Everlasting Love Gift Set.

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:08.385
It comes in a Prince Edition
and a Princess Edition.

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.077
The Prince Edition features...

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.462
A woody, spicy fragrance.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.885
What are you doing?

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:29.000
Hey. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:30.346
What is that?

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.616
This belonged to the late Queen.

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:37.923
It has been kept
in the First Prince's private vault.

00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:43.616
The First Princess
stole an heirloom of the late Queen.

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:45.808
Take her away.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.654
Move.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.846
Over there.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.085
Mr. Li, thank you for sharing so much
technical support with us,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.920
and for trusting us
with such a major contract.

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.777
You are too kind, Your Highness.

00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:03.662
I look forward
to your continued guidance.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:04.546
Certainly.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.431
Very well.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:06.600
Then I will take my leave.

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:08.046
Of course. Safe travels.

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:09.623
Goodbye.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.123
Boss, something has gone wrong.

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:17.290
The Queen sent people to disrupt
the First Princess's livestream.

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:22.815
Seize her.

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.162
This way.

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:34.739
Nobody move.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.585
You are framing me.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:44.046
I did not take anything.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.969
It is perfume.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:52.815
Take her.

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:56.162
Over here.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:02:59.700
You lunatic.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.340
Let go of me.

00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.008
Guan Mengmeng.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:08.854
Looks like today finally came.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:18.354
You finally made it.

00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.190
Rui, I have missed you terribly.

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:24.162
Where is Lan Yue?

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:26.085
Lan Yue?

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.354
He went to meet the general.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.892
What happens between us

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.354
must never reach His Majesty.

00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:36.090
Wen was a gifted scholar

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:38.315
who grew up alongside Guan Xinrui.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:39.739
They loved each other deeply

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.046
and were meant to marry.

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:44.162
But to secure
an alliance with Manbo Kingdom,

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:46.508
the Emperor chose Guan Xinrui

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:49.662
as a political bride,
separating the lovers.

00:03:58.777 --> 00:03:59.354
Mengmeng.

00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:00.585
Mengmeng.

00:04:01.354 --> 00:04:02.431
Wake up, Mengmeng.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.354
Wake up.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.162
Mengmeng.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.623
Wake up.

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:18.969
Stop it.

00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:23.546
Is that you, Mengmeng?

00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:28.777
Wen, did you not say you missed me?

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:33.585
Rui.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.008
My Rui.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:36.585
Enough.

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:38.123
Who are you?

00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:46.623
(What just happened?)

00:04:47.123 --> 00:04:48.777
(It felt as if time froze.)

00:04:49.662 --> 00:04:50.392
(Song Pai?)

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:54.777
Let her go.

00:04:56.123 --> 00:04:56.892
Release her.

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:00.162
Rui.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.008
Have you lost your senses?

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:04.931
Rui?

00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:07.892
She is my wife, Guan Mengmeng.

00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:12.162
Second Princess.

00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:13.931
Second Princess.

00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:17.123
The Queen is waiting.

00:05:19.162 --> 00:05:20.123
May I ask,

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.546
why my wife has been detained?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.380
The First Princess is suspected
of stealing royal property.

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.739
By order of the Queen,
she is to be held for investigation.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:29.700
You old witch.

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:31.123
Those items were for my livestream.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.585
You have no right to call it theft.

00:05:32.892 --> 00:05:33.392
Mengmeng.

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:35.200
Your Highness.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.730
You cannot shield her
simply because she is your wife.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.354
Theft is not something to take lightly.

00:05:40.354 --> 00:05:41.392
Am I asking you?

00:05:43.623 --> 00:05:45.354
We were mistaken.

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:49.162
Second Princess.

00:05:51.623 --> 00:05:52.700
Do not look.

00:05:55.777 --> 00:05:56.546
Leave now.

00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:23.157
(In that illusion,)

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.850
(the version of me and the woman
who looks like Guan Mengmeng)

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:27.965
(what is the connection between us?)

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.888
Nana.

00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:34.926
Nana.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.426
Are you alright?

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:39.157
What happened?

00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:42.349
Second Prince,

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:44.195
please remember who you are.

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:46.080
Mother really went too far.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.426
Mother is always punishing you like this.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.370
What are you doing?

00:06:54.388 --> 00:06:54.965
Sit down.

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:55.772
Let go.

00:06:55.772 --> 00:06:56.349
Sit down.

00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:03.272
Second Prince.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.734
If you have nothing better to do...

00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:05.234
Do not move.

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:09.542
Does it hurt?

00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:13.311
(If Lin Ge put this much effort)

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:15.811
(into fighting for power,
it would be so much better.)

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.208
(Still,)

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.938
(he truly is a gentle man.)

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.738
Is it done?

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:29.777
Yes.

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:38.777
By the way,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.162
we have raised one hundred
and twenty million.

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:42.777
One hundred and twenty million?

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.085
Really?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.623
That puts us just a bit
behind my brother.

00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:54.008
We will reach five hundred million soon.

00:07:54.354 --> 00:07:55.123
I promised you.

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:56.585
I will make sure you win.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:57.815
I mean it.

00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:00.508
Nana, you really are impressive.

00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:18.469
What is going on?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.150
Why is it happening again so fast?

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:23.969
I need to see a doctor.

00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:09.546
Move in.

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:20.815
(This necklace…)

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:22.390
(If it stays, it will only bring trouble.)

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.508
(It has to be destroyed.)

00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:35.508
Ah!

00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:36.546
Song Pai.

00:09:36.738 --> 00:09:37.123
Mengmeng.

00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:39.046
What are you doing in here?

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:40.969
Listen to me.

00:09:40.969 --> 00:09:41.200
I…

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:43.123
You were in the shower for so long,

00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:44.580
I got worried something had happened.

00:09:46.162 --> 00:09:46.931
You creep.

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:48.123
Mengmeng, let me explain.

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:51.931
Ah!

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.392
Close your eyes.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.431
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.354
Close your eyes.

00:09:56.354 --> 00:09:58.085
I swear I did not see anything.

00:09:59.008 --> 00:09:59.623
Do not look.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.815
I really did not see anything.

00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:01.354
Eyes closed.

00:10:01.354 --> 00:10:03.046
I swear, Mengmeng.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.392
I told you to close your eyes.

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:05.623
They are closed.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.469
Keep them closed.

00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:08.392
Do not open them.

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:11.431
Are you done yet?

00:10:11.815 --> 00:10:12.854
Song Pai.

00:10:23.738 --> 00:10:24.931
You can clearly see everything.

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:25.623
I…

00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:27.085
You jerk!

00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:47.354
Guan Mengmeng.

00:10:48.969 --> 00:10:50.315
You are still the same girl

00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:52.277
I fell for at first sight.

00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:55.931
Thank you.

00:10:56.277 --> 00:10:57.623
Thank you for coming today,

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.123
even after everything.

00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:04.990
I thought you hated me by now,
and never wanted to see me again.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.200
We did share something real once.

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.008
If you asked to see me,

00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:12.354
how could I not come?

00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:16.315
Are you not afraid

00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:17.931
your First Prince

00:11:18.585 --> 00:11:19.508
will be angry?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.508
I was more afraid you would be hurt.

00:11:23.123 --> 00:11:24.738
I knew you still cared about me.

00:11:24.738 --> 00:11:25.277
Let us

00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:27.315
share a drink together.

00:11:27.623 --> 00:11:28.738
Let bygones

00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:30.585
be bygones.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:35.508
Then you will have to tell me everything

00:11:35.738 --> 00:11:37.200
that has happened during this time.

00:11:38.123 --> 00:11:39.315
Alright, no problem.

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:46.777
(You lying man.)

00:11:46.777 --> 00:11:48.046
(Let us see)

00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:50.238
(what tricks you are trying to pull.)

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.770
Boss, something is wrong. The Princess
did not come back all night.

00:12:43.477 --> 00:12:44.169
First Princess?

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:47.285
Where is the boss?

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.230
