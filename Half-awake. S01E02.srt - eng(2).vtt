00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.520
I've already looked into it.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.200
That sly old fox, Mr. Lu,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.780
(Chu Muzhi)
wants to control Ye Xingwan

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320
and found evidence of our trap.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.560
Ye Xingwan hurt herself.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.100
That's how she managed to escape.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.360
I told you before

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.520
every move Ye Xingwan makes

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.200
must be under our watch.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.590
You were in charge that day, right?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.960
Mr. Gu, it was my failure.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.220
I deserve to be punished.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.840
It's fine.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.800
Just take your punishment.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.120
Mr. Gu, I was wrong. Mr. Gu.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.200
Please forgive me, Mr. Gu.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.480
I was wrong, Mr. Gu.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.400
Please forgive me, Mr. Gu.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.200
Mr. Gu...

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.720
Where's Lu?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.320
I've already dealt with him.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.800
That crafty old man

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.380
got so scared that he could barely move.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.880
He dared to cross you.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.400
He should've known what was coming.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.880
How's Ye Xingwan?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560
I've followed you for so many years,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680
and it's the first time I've seen

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.360
you care about her.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.160
What's going on?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.200
What I care about is not her life,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080
but that she cannot escape my control.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.440
Every bit of pain she feels
can only be given by me,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.720
inflicted slowly by me.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.680
No one else is allowed.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.220
Glad you haven't forgotten.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.360
After all, your dad

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.200
died because of her.

(Five years ago)

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.240
Let go of my mom!

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.680
What are you doing?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.160
Who are you people?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.040
Breaking into my home, what do you want?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.640
You don't recognize me?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.000

Law Major. (Support Admin Watch on

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.560
Seems your father, Ye Qishan,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.760
has raised

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920
a smart and well-mannered daughter.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.320
Since you're so brave,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320
why don't you tell me

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.560
how this debt should be repaid

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.260
after your father ran away

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.920
owing me a hundred million?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
One hundred million?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.060
(Ye's mother)

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.680

to repay her father's debts.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.240
Tell me, shouldn't you be the one

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.680
to repay this debt for him?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.600
Keep dreaming.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.140
You broke into my home.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.320
And you even hurt someone.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.760
I'm calling the police on you.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.240
Call the police?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.160
Go ahead.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.600
Hand her the phone.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.040
Call the police.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.760
Your sister...

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.620
She's still in middle school, right?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.800
Her name's Ye Xingyue.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.680
She studies at Bihai Middle School.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.920
Xingyue...

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.880
Xingwan,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.960
no, no.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.900
Don't call the police.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.120
Don't call the police.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.960
Don't call the police.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.240
If you want something, come at me.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.880
Stay away from my sister.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.480
Make the call to drop out of school.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.120
From now on, you'll do what I say.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.900
You're smart.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.160
You should know what you're worth.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.080
If you just follow orders,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960
I'll naturally

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.360
let your family go.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.200
What value do I have?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.280
Of course you have.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
It's just a pity

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.760
you'll never wear
that school uniform again.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.980
Sis.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.880
Sis, you're awake.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.760
Come on.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320
What's wrong with me?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.480
The cut on your hand got infected.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.880
You've had a high fever
and been out cold for days.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.960
Sis,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.520
I really need to say this to you.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.800
Don't mess around outside every day.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.640
You're Yixiao's secretary now.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.040
Even if you don't care about yourself,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.480
at least don't embarrass him.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.000
Embarrass?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.020
Then why do you think Gu Yixiao

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.680
keeps letting his secretary

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.880
fall into such a messy state

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.920
and lose all self-respect?

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.960
You're saying Yixiao's
not a good guy, right?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.480
I'm grown now.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.440
I can see things clearly
with my own eyes.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.880
Sis,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.240
I don't know what happened
between you and Yixiao.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240
But all these years

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.240
he's really been good to us.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.240
I honestly like him a lot.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.160
You'd also want me

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.400
to find happiness, right?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.720
You want to see me?

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.400
You told her to come to my room?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.720
I didn't know that Wang Yaqin...

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.080
Don't mention her name.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.360
Sorry.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.920
Yixiao,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.280
these past few years,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.400
your attitude toward Ye Xingwan

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.600
has changed a lot.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.200
Yixiao.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.780
(Wang Qi: Find out?
Is my dad's death related to him?)

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.240
I'm begging you.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.140
We haven't eaten or had water
for three days.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.720

to the warehouse at Pier 19.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.680
Once you get it done,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.800
all past debts will be cleared.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.240
If there is even the slightest damage

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.400
to anything in here,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.400
I'll make sure your dad

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.960
