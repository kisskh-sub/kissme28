(Qifang Pavilion)

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.430
Has she awakened?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.150
Yes,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.560
but...

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.550
I understand.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.600
You may leave.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.190
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
A lifetime of devotion...

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.120
Zhao Qingru.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.280
You wretch! You wretch!

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.070
I'll kill you.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.950
Come here, I'll kill you.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.630
You wretch!

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.790
You wretch!

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.960
I'll kill you.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.350
You wretch, come here!

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.760
I'll kill you.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'll kill you.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.990
Come here.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.000
I'll kill you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.430
Did you use the Fan Scorpion Poison?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.120
I won't tell you.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.150
Enough of this charade!

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910
You wretch, I'll kill you!

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.200
Come here.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.630
I'll kill you!

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.990
Zhao Qingru.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.430
Li Jingxu's dead from his injuries.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.800
You wretch.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.430
I'll kill you.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.640
You wretch.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.710
You wretch!

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.870
What took you so long?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.360
Don't leave.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.680
Come here.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.870
Come here.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.000
Come here, I'll kill you!

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.120
Come back.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.000
I'll kill you!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.200
You wretch!

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.750
You wretch!

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910
You wretch come here! Where are you?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.590
She didn't react
when I said Li Jingxu was dead.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.190
She truly has lost her mind.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.400
She's now not in her right mind.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.710
We don't know when she'll recover.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.680
We won't get anything from her.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.750
I'll fetch a physician.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.630
Let's see if she can be restored.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.150
I once thought Zhao Qingru
was the mastermind

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.680
behind everything.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.470
But now it seems

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.080
the murder of my mother,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.520
Qin Ruoyi,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.030
and even Shopkeeper Liu,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.280
might be someone else.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.470
We still have one clue.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.910
You mean the Fragrant Concubine
Treading on Snow Yuzhu mentioned?

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.310
Exactly.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.150
I've sent Xu Shan to investigate.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.710
Results should come soon.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.400
We might as well bide our time.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.800
Alright.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.280
This scent is
Fragrant Concubine Treading on Snow.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.630
I feel like

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.560
I've smelled it somewhere before.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.080
General.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.960
I have confirmed it.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.240
This scent is only sold

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.280
at that spice shop
in the eastern part of the city.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.840
Someone from Li Manor

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.560
did go there to buy it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.200
Who?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.710
Lady Xingwan's maid,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.030
Zhenzhu.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.840
Wan'er?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.560
Sister-in-law.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.950
You came to see me?

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.150
Yes.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.470
Sister-in-law,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.190
I don't know why
Mother tried to harm Brother.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.310
Now that things have come to this,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.680
I don't even know what to do.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.760
Don't worry.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.720
Your brother and I will protect you.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.800
Your room smells so lovely.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.920
What incense is this?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.870
Just ordinary spices, nothing special.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.160
If you like it,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.270
I'll give it to you.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.270
This is what I'm currently using.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.510
It does smell nice.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.120
Didn't expect you to know
so much about incense.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.720
It looks quite delicate.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.390
I just bought these randomly.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800
I can't claim to be knowledgeable.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.950
This scent is quite special too.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.240
Before I lost consciousness,
I smelled a certain fragrance.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.760
This scent is only sold

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.950
at that spice shop
in the eastern part of the city.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.400
Someone from Li Manor

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.190
did go there to buy it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.840
Who?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.160
Lady Xingwan's maid,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.560
Zhenzhu.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.870
If you like it,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.110
you can have it all.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.510
Where is the General?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.750
He went to barracks

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.760
and hasn't returned.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.200
What's wrong, My Lady?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.480
Nothing. You may leave.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.320
Yes.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.270
(The scent is exactly the same.)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.120
(It's Fragrant Concubine Treading on Snow.)

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.800
Sister-in-law, may I come in?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.920
Sister-in-law, you truly are resilient.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.870
You endured such pain
without a single word.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.630
Today, you punished Nanny Sun.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.840
It can be considered

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.680
standing up for me, and for those

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.800
she tormented.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.560
Did she treat you like that?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600
You're the Lady of the Li family.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.830
How could a servant...

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.510
You may not know, sister-in-law.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.720
I was actually adopted by the Li family.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.430
You must be hungry.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.190
I believe you did not push Concubine Qin.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.750
You couldn't possibly do such a thing.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.950
I often saw Xiaocui,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.480
Concubine Qin's maid,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.870
sneaking out the back gate.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.720
She seemed rather secretive.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.270
I wonder if she's meeting a lover.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.720
Is the case concluded?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680
You just woke up. How do you know?

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.600
Wan'er told me everything.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.040
(If all her care and closeness)

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.120
(were just tests and subtle instigations,)

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.000
(then such deep scheming
is truly terrifying.)

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.390
(If she's really behind all this,)

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.430
(why was she so ruthless
in killing my mother?)

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.830
How is Jingxu's injury?

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.550
He still can't get out of bed or walk.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.430
What a loser.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.600
Jingxu is your legitimate son,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.240
but he has made mistakes

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.390
with Mother these years.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.510
Jingchuan is a concubine-born,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.120
but his military merits are great.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.360
Maybe the Marquis title...

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.160
Why are you so concerned about that?

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.750
I just wish to share your worries.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.310
Jingxu was ruined by that wretch.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.920
Jingchuan has never been close to me.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.400
Father,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.720
the bond between father and son

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.630
can be nurtured over time.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.390
Do you mean to make me
bow my head to that boy?

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.190
What insolence!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.430
That's not what I meant, Father.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.680
If Brother's wife

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.270
often speaks well

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.920
of you to him

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.240
and helps mend your relationship,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.120
it would be more effective.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.150
Sadly, now sister-in-law…

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.790
You mean Shen?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160
What's wrong with her?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.150
If Brother truly marries a virtuous wife,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.960
it would be a blessing for our family.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.960
Father, you just woke up.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.000
You may not know.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.240
Though Shen is the legitimate
daughter of Prefect Shen,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.600
she's been disliked by her father.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.000
Her mother is deranged.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.150
Since marrying Brother,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.600
she not only drove out Concubine Tang,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.320
but also, by unknown means,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.720
caused Concubine Qin's death.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.240
She's narrow-minded and overly jealous.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.360
How could...

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.030
How could such a woman
be my daughter-in-law!

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.840
Mother arranged this marriage for Brother.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.360
That wretch

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.480
actually allowed such a woman

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.150
to become my son's Principal Wife!

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.600
This is unacceptable!

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.160
This is unacceptable!

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.320
Guards!

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.710
Guards!

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.320
Bring Jingchuan here!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.560
Marquis.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.440
What?

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.910
You don't call me Father now?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.400
You called me here

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.840
just to hear me call you Father?

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.440
Is that all?

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.960
Military matters have

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.280
exhausted me.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
Li Jingchuan!

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.440
Don't you think being General

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.600
lets you lord over me.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.080
No matter what, I'm still your father.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.560
Father.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.680
Father,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.870
please calm down.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.750
Your current status

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240
is not only a member of the Li family,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.080
but also a General
valued by His Majesty.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.910
You must be mindful of
your words and conduct.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.630
I know

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.200
while I was in a coma,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.720
Zhao Qingru arranged your marriage

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.750
without asking for your wishes.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.910
Today, I will decide for you.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.440
You shall divorce Shen.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.750
I'll find you another suitable match.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.390
Marquis, this is none of your concern.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.270
I will not divorce Yaochu.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.790
Shen comes from a humble family,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.440
and her conduct is corrupt.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.480
Such a woman

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.550
will do your career no good.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.670
What you care about is
family background and career.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.150
But what I care about

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.910
is whether the one who marries me

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.510
is truly the one I love.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.600
I don't care about her family.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.240
If it ends up like yours,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.320
a marriage built on schemes and gain,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320
and not a shred of love,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.910
can only lead to

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.200
a bitter end as enemies.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.630
Li Jingchuan,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.720
today, let me tell you this.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.560
Whether you

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.080
agree or not,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.000
you'll divorce her.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.870
Then let me tell you, Marquis,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.080
you cannot make decisions for me.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.080
Guards!

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.790
Ready the house punishment!

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.550
My Lady, bad news!

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.390
Has the General returned?

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.000
General angered the Old Marquis.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.360
He's being punished in the courtyard.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.160
