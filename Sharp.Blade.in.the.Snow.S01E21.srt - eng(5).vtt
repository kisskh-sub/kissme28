[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.980
[Episode 21]

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.240
Yun Zhan!

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.760
Your Majesty!

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.280
Yun Zhan!

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.800
Your Majesty!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.260
-Yun Zhan!
-Your Majesty!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.920
Yun Zhan!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.720
Your Majesty!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.690
Yun Zhan!

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.850
Yun Zhan!

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.360
Your Majesty!

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.250
Hurry up!

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.560
Search the eastern area again.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.520
They couldn't have gone far.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.280
Yes!

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.480
Young Master,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.920
we've searched all surrounding woods

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380
but found no trace of them.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.450
Keep searching!

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.280
Yes!

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.560
Someone's by the river!

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.760
It's... Her Majesty!

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.160
What happened?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.490
We were ambushed

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.980
by assassins on the way

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.210
and unfortunately fell into the lake.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.720
I'm glad you're fine.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.720
Let's carry Her Majesty to the carriage

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.080
and take her to the nearest post station.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.960
-Okay.
-Guards!

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.520
Hurry!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.360
Careful.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.050
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.520
Wake up.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.880
Wake up.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.140
Feng Li, you're awake.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.690
Are you feeling unwell?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.720
Don't be afraid.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720
I'm here with you.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.930
No one will harm you.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.690
She doesn't look right.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.620
What's wrong with her?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.290
Her pulse is rapid,
with blood flowing backward.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.600
She must have

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.480
fallen into water, caught a chill,
and been frightened.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.680
Her vocal cords are damaged

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.079
and she's lost her voice.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.900
Lost her voice?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.040
What should we do?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.400
We'll leave for Mocheng immediately

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400
to find the best doctor to treat you.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.800
A long delay may cause trouble.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.560
We'll rest briefly

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.880
and then set out for Mocheng at once.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.740
As you command.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.760
We'll soon reach Mocheng.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.900
Stone King of Hell,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.720
I'm afraid you'll have to endure
some hardships once we reach there.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.480
It's all for Her Majesty.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.520
No matter what happens,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.490
proceed according to plan.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.320
Faster!

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.370
Don't delay
Princess Royal's important matter.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.050
Mission accomplished.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.720
Your Highness,
I've brought the Queen for you.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.080
Li,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680
you're finally back.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.000
Take a look.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960
This little thing

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.200
has finally reached my hands.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.340
What's wrong with her?

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.240
She was fed a bowl of bewildering soup

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.370
and has temporarily lost her mind.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.800
If she becomes a fool,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.460
how will I get the Tiger Tally?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840
This is only temporary.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.360
Within a few days,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.810
she'll gradually regain consciousness.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.600
Li,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.440
will you give the Tiger Tally
and Phoenix Incense formula

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.000
to me?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.730
You won't tell me, will you?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.120
Let me try.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.120
Fingers are very sensitive.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.490
One prick with the knife...

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.240
Even if she doesn't speak,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.680
she could still write something down.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.040
She's my own niece.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.100
How could I let you harm her in any way?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.320
Li, you've been obedient since young

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.050
and have always listened to me.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.840
You just haven't figured it out yet.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.480
Everything I do

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.840
is for your own good.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.480
Once you understand,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.340
you'll hand over
the Tiger Tally naturally.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.680
Princess Royal, a report from the front:

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.200
Young Master of Xiqi
will return to the palace

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.730
with Her Majesty tomorrow.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.360
We have guests coming.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.240
Come.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.200
My sweetheart,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.040
you need to hide for a while.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.600
I care for you so much.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.840
I'll find the most suitable place

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.240
to keep you hidden.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.160
Don't worry.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.120
I'll find someone

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.600
who will love you dearly

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.320
to play with you every day.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.280
Alright?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.920
Li?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.800
Li.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.000
Li!

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.490
It's really you.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.280
Li,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.560
you're back!

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.080
You're back.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.000
I'm sorry, Li.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.640
I offended you.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.130
Don't be afraid.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.890
I won't touch you again.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.159
I'm just

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.200
so happy you're back.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.260
What's wrong with you?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.440
Why aren't you speaking?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.050
Are you feeling unwell?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.940
What happened to your throat?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.880
Who did this to you?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.700
What did they do to you?

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.000
Was it Meng Wu?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.880
Tell me.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.520
Was it Meng Wu?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.480
Was it her?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.440
I'm sorry.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.640
I'm not blaming you.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.840
I was just so afraid.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520
So afraid that...

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.840
you would never come back.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440
It's okay.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.159
This is fine too.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.240
This way you won't run away.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.799
If you don't speak,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.520
you can't argue with me.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.800
You'll never run off to

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
places where I can't see you.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.920
You finally

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.640
belong only to me now.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.160
My sweetheart,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.520
how did you come back from Xiqi

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.120
so thin?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.840
Your voice is damaged too.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.600
It really breaks my heart.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.520
Li,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.120
I've brought

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.440
your favorite pastries.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.160
Here.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.640
Try this.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.480
Take your time.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.480
I heard you two were inseparable in Xiqi,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.940
and you accompanied her
on the journey back.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.040
Now Li's ended up like this.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.400
Is this how your Xiqi

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.640
treats the guests?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.600
Her Majesty and I get along very well.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.440
Everyone in Xiqi treats Her Majesty
with the utmost respect.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.360
However, on our way back,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.720
there was an accident.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.280
Her Majesty accidentally
fell into the water

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.280
and lost her voice due to the cold.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.600
Who was so careless

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.360
to let Li suffer such harm?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.600
Are your guards in Xiqi

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.040
just for show?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
The culprit responsible

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.400
for Her Majesty's fall into the water

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.880
has already been sent back to the capital.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.610
Bring him in.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.840
So it's you,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.200
Yun Zhan.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.600
You, a lowly male concubine,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.680
secretly followed the Queen to Xiqi.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.720
How incredibly loyal

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.040
and devoted of you.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.360
I always keep my promise.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.240
Your memory serves you well.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.000
You speak of promises,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.720
but who knows
what you've promised to whom.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080
Your Highness,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.160
you're still so forgetful.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.810
If you've truly forgotten,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.720
I don't mind refreshing your memory.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
Take him away!

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.810
Don't be afraid, Li.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.770
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.880
If anyone makes you suffer,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.970
I will have them torn to pieces.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.520
This man is yours to deal with.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.320
As you command.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.520
Don't let him die too quickly.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.200
I've just met that Queen.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.760
I don't know where you found her,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.440
but she looks remarkably similar.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.600
If her temperament wasn't so different,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.040
even I'd have been fooled for a moment.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.400
She's just a village woman

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.680
who happens to have a useful face.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.760
Being of even a little help
to Your Highness

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.440
is her greatest honor.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.280
This plan is brilliant.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.160
That mute woman

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.320
has now become my obedient niece.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.800
I've also found the person you wanted.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.040
You must keep your promise.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.160
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.120
I will do my utmost.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.160
By the way,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.840
that Young Master of Xiqi is elegant,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.880
but he has never removed his mask.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.440
Do you think under that mask

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.000
is the real Young Master?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.340
I've had my doubts as well.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.840
It's said the Young Master of Xiqi
has been frail since childhood

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.800
and must wear a mask to ward off evil.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.400
He does the same in Xiqi.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.320
Few have seen his true face.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.360
Go investigate.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.660
If he truly is the Young Master of Xiqi

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.000
and falls into our hands,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.930
he'd certainly be a valuable pawn.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.460
If we can take advantage and secure Xiqi,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.360
then Mocheng and Xiqi

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.280
will truly become one family.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.640
As you command.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.320
I will thoroughly investigate

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.960
the identity of the Young Master of Xiqi

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960
and won't miss any useful weakness.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.040
What do you mean, Feng Li?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.480
You came back without telling me

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.680
and even dared to lock me in the mansion.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.080
I heard you were sick

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.160
and became mute.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.970
Well, I won't go easy on you.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.600
I'm here to scold you,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.480
not to apologize.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.940
These days when you were away,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.130
Aunt came to my place every day.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.840
Now it's just the two of us here.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.320
No one can hear us.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440
Stop pretending.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.040
Why are you acting?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.960
You're mute,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.200
not an idiot!

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.760
Why are you so cowardly?

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.260
Who are you really?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.880
Did you put on a human skin mask

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.080
to impersonate Feng Li?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.880
Feng Ling'er!

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.900
Have you had enough of this nonsense?

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.520
So what if I'm making a scene?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.800
She's the one
who came back with an attitude,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.960
playing the victim.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600
I just hate her.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.170
Princess Ling,
time to return to your residence.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.930
If you continue this behavior,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.780
the consequences
will be worse than just house arrest.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.840
Aunt, go ahead and protect her.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.200
One day,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.360
I'll make her beg me on her knees.
