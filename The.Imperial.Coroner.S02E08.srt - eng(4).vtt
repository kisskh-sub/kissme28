00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.600
(Master Shenguan is a eminent monk of Nanzhao,
and the matter is of great consequence.)

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.079
(You Chen'an strongly urged
the Three Judicial Offices)

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.519
(not to perform an autopsy
on the sacred body)

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.800
(to avoid conflict
between the two states.)

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.039
(As expected, Vice Envoy,
Gao Luoqian raised objections,)

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.879
(even stirred up trouble
by using the fact)

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.600
(that Chu Chu is a woman
serving as a coroner.)

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.519
(In court,)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.479
(I could only
avoid the confrontation for the moment)

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.960
(and seek another way.)

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.920
(Fortunately, His Highness and I)

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.520
(thought alike)

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479
(and had You Chen'an
examine the body for me.)

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.359
(The outcome was favorable,)

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.759
(yet I could not shake the feeling)

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.200
(that His Highness was keeping
other concerns from me.)

=Episode 8= (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.620
(Music Office)

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.120
His Majesty favors rising newcomers,

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.919
with the Jing Family
backing them in secret.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.719
Half the court now stands behind
Commandery Prince An.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.560
How could he not grow arrogant?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.840
By that measure,

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.520
he has been

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.520
rather restrained with us.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.319
Nonsense.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.360
By using criminal cases
to interfere in local appointments,

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.960
Commandery Prince An's intentions

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.520
are impossible to miss.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.439
And that is called restraint?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.120
Exactly.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.400
Everyone,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.039
do not be discouraged.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.479
On the contrary,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.960
this is the right moment
to press the advantage.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.439
This...

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.120
How so?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.360
It might

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.919
just turn the tide.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.080
Jiang,

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.159
what do you mean?

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.159
Yes.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.439
That day,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.840
His Majesty did not reject
Commandery Prince An's request,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.719
yet

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.919
he reprimanded the Princess Consort.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.080
You mean

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.159
we should start with
the Commandery Princess Consort An?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.360
But she and the Prince

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.599
are deeply devoted,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.919
always acting in unison.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.280
That...

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.080
So devoted, indeed.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.759
Precisely because of that,

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.039
bring one down,

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:47.800
and the other

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.439
will be dragged under as well.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.680
A fine move.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.400
Jiang,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.280
you have a plan?

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.759
Come,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.599
drink.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.199
Your Majesty.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.159
What is it?

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:13.560
The matter of Xie Huaiding

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.680
has made progress.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.360
Speak.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.319
Years ago, Xie Huaiding had a child

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.920
with a singing girl.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.319
According to our informants,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.759
(Menghua. Guard of Nanzhao's Eldest Prince)
the child has now ended up in Nanzhao.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.560
Heaven favors Nanzhao.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.560
So the Three Judicial Offices of Great Tang

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.759
are nothing but empty names.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.920
Such vital intelligence,
yet they knew nothing.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.199
It seems Xiao Jinyu

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.879
is not as meticulous as claimed.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.120
How is the Peacock operation progressing?

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.399
Peacock has taken over all informants

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.360
around Commandery Prince An.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.720
His Majesty's plan

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.720
is fully in motion.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.480
We need only wait for results.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.340
(Map of the Great Tang Realm)

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.199
At present,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.360
the Uyghurs and Tanguts in the north,

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.120
and Tubo in the west,

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.600
all eye the Great Tang with hostility.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.720
Nanzhao sees this clearly

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.439
(Xie Huaiding, Cavalry General)

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.600
and seeks to profit from the chaos

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.279
to claim its share.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.800
I do not wish my people to suffer war,

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:28.079
yet he takes my restraint for fear.

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.879
Your Majesty.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.319
Let me go.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.079
These years in the capital,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.680
I have grown idle to the bone.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.800
Those Nanzhao people

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.120
dare think of riding over us,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.040
I...

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.519
The frost-forged halberd in my hand

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.839
will not permit it.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.160
Unless Nanzhao's
hostile intent is put to rest,

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.800
I

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.920
will not return to court.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.560
These seasonings

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.279
I brought from my home in Qianzhou.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.439
In the Great Tang,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.120
it's all peppercorns and evodia.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.120
You can't find real Qianzhou heat here.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.920
Let me fan you.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.399
Alright.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.480
It's getting late.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.839
He.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.639
I need to buy green plums for autopsies.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.600
Otherwise I'll miss the West Market.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:18.800
I'll head off then.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.639
Chu.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.759
I'll go with you.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.399
They're heavy. I'll carry them.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.759
He, stay seated.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.560
I'll go with her.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.000
You eat.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.000
You go?

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.240
Alright, take it.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.560
I'm off, He.

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:29.560
Take care.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.879
Mm.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.839
Have a look around.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.160
I'll help you.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.079
Thanks.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.279
Deputy Prefect Leng.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.759
Come.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.399
Quick.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.500
(Leng Baichuan)
Rare to see

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.160
(Deputy Prefect of the Capital)
you patrolling in person.

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.199
Indeed, Prefect.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.160
The streets
haven't been peaceful lately.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.199
So I had to come myself.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.120
More than just unrest.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.800
It's been quite a scene.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.920
Newlyweds being all affectionate,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.639
and then that...

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.839
Isn't that
the Commandery Princess Consort An?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.319
And beside her...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.360
Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.959
Second Prince of Nanzhao?

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:44.600
Those two...

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.360
How could that be?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.740
(Three Judicial Offices)

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.240
Your Highness.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.920
Chu Chu.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:09.319
Chu Chu.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.079
Reporting to Your Highness,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.399
this is the autopsy sheet

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:14.199
jointly signed by You Chen'an and me.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.639
One copy will be kept
by the Nanzhao delegation.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.839
The other

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.639
is for your review.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:23.600
Chu Chu...

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.600
You Chen'an said

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:26.600
he will do his best
to persuade Gao Luoqian

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.600
to honor Master Shenguan's memory

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.560
and let the matter rest.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.039
I'll take my leave.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.679
Chu...

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:51.440
Jing Yi.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.240
You're here.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.080
These past few days,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.200
I've been holding the scalpel too much.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.559
My hand's gone a bit numb.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.519
Seen enough?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.399
Not yet.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.679
Of course not.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:20.080
Even the ever-unshakable
Commandery Prince An

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:23.240
can be unsettled
by matters of the heart.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.360
What do you mean,
"matters of the heart"?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.840
Chu Chu and I...

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.919
Watch your words.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.759
If such jokes get out

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:32.799
and stir trouble,

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.679
I'll tell Leng Yue everything

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:35.840
about your hidden savings.

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:38.039
The autopsy record is done.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.080
It matches the statements

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.080
from Jing Yuan and the others.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.480
We've checked every household
where rituals were performed.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.240
No issues found.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.159
The case is closed.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.919
Since You Chen'an
has endorsed the autopsy report,

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.080
we can silence Nanzhao's objections.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.559
Still, Your Highness,

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.120
you seem uneasy.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.679
From Gao Luoqian's stance

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.039
when he demanded the body,

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.799
he appeared overly confident.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.639
Shenguan's death

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.360
gave Nanzhao

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.120
a ready pretext
to challenge the Great Tang.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:10.919
And Jing Yuan,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.759
who was deeply devoted to his master,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.840
also said

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:16.159
there were no hidden ailments.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.799
Just as we were closing in on Peacock,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.279
the master died suddenly.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.919
Taken together,

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:24.440
it's too much of a coincidence.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.080
Besides, we still have a key witness

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.159
to verify.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:29.799
You mean Qinxiang?

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.799
Master Shenguan
was revered by the people

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.120
in both lands,

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.879
and respected
by his peers and disciples.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.480
He was not a frivolous man.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.519
He went to
the Music Office in plain clothes

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.759
not for romantic entanglements.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.960
Until the truth is clear,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.200
this case stays open.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.159
Go back to the Music Office

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.240
and take a hard look at Qinxiang.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.120
As for the Music Office,

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.720
I'll bring Yue.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.639
Between husband and wife,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.440
it's about trust and standing together.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.159
No matter how big the issue,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.720
it must be laid out plainly.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.440
If we hide things from each other,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.960
we might as well part ways.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.559
Your Highness.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.960
You're clear-headed about everything,

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.159
so why do you get stuck
when it comes to Chu Chu?

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.480
Snap out of it.

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:25.759
Yue keeps saying you must've done

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.120
something to wrong Chu Chu.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:32.200
I can only put up
with this for one night.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.600
She really said that?

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.200
Put your mind at ease.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:40.399
You've been
too focused on Chu Chu lately,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.279
and not on me.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.759
As if I haven't cared enough.

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.919
I dropped everything on my plate

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.039
just to work this case with you.

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.360
Of course my innocence

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.440
has to be watched over by my lady.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.639
Enough.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.080
May I ask which Sir

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.840
and Madam...

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.960
It's you again.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.039
This time,

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.320
are you here to hear a tune,

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.919
or to ask questions?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.159
I've already told you

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960
everything I should.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240
So you still insist

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.759
you had nothing to do
with Master Shenguan?

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.759
I don't even know

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.440
what kind of master he was.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:24.559
If you want answers,

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.320
you should've asked him.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.919
That's a shame.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:30.240
Master Shenguan is dead.

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.279
What did you say?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200
He's dead?

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:40.720
That's impossible.

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.360
You barely knew him,

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.559
why care so much?

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:46.519
After all,

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:48.960
we did cross paths once.

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:50.519
My apologies to you both.

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:51.799
If there's nothing else,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.039
I need to get back to work.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.799
Qinxiang.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.360
Mr. Zhao is here again.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:04.600
The two of you...

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:08.799
In that case,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.360
please excuse yourself.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.679
My dear.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.519
Let's go.

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.200
Leaving already?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.919
Take care.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.600
Take care.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.799
Qinxiang.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.440
Hurry up.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.559
Mr. Zhao is waiting.

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.799
Move it.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:29.020
(Music Office)

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:33.559
Something's off.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.879
You felt it too, right?

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:43.159
Her reaction to Master Shenguan's death

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:45.639
was not that of someone
who barely knew him.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.159
Agreed.

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:49.480
When the dancer came out just now,

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:51.039
she said Mr. Zhao was looking for her.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.679
Mr. Zhao?

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.240
- Zhao…
- Zhao…

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.440
I'll take a look.

00:13:59.159 --> 00:13:59.600
My lady.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.519
Don't alert them.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:03.720
Let's play the eavesdroppers instead.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.440
Since Mr. Zhao is here,

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.799
we might as well hear
the tune that made her famous.

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:09.639
Sounds good.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.740
(Zhao Senyao, the son
of Vice Minister Zhao of Ministry of Rites)

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.399
Young Master.

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.519
Zhao Senyao.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.159
So it really is him.

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:43.120
Qinxiang seems terrified of him.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.159
Young Master.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:48.480
You wretch!

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.600
You dared scheme against me.

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.639
You wretch!

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.120
Please spare me, Young Master.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.000
Young Master.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:54.559
I was wrong.

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:55.919
Please spare me.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.240
I was wrong.

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.240
So you even found a monk to shield you.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.399
Wasn't he treating your skin condition?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.159
Treating you?

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:04.600
You don't deserve to live.

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:05.600
You wretch.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.799
You wretch.

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:08.440
I'll strangle you!

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:10.960
You wretch.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.399
Who are you calling a wretch?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.000
Say it. Who is the wretch?

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.639
It hurts.

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:24.200
Senyao.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.120
It's been a long time.

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:28.720
Beating an official courtesan
without cause?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.480
You've grown bold.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.600
Impressive...

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.639
So you found Vice Minister Jing
to back you up.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.080
A misunderstanding.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:36.399
A misunderstanding.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.759
Young Master
was only fooling around with me.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.399
Just playing.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.639
Playing?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.120
He was trying to kill you.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:51.799
Qinxiang.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.759
Don't be afraid.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.039
As long as you tell the truth,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.279
the Three Judicial Offices
will see justice done.

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:00.840
So what about
the Three Judicial Offices?

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.120
You think you're untouchable?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.679
You can just hit people at will?

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.720
Was I hitting a person?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480
Vice Minister Jing.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.320
Bringing your wife to the Music Office?

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:12.879
Your Three Judicial Offices
sure know how to amuse themselves.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.639
Look closely.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:16.879
I paid for this entertainment.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.360
She agreed to it.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:19.480
Didn't you?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.000
Yes.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.240
Yes.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.840
Thank you for the reward, Young Master.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:25.879
Bad luck.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:27.720
Say that again!

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:31.279
Ridiculous.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.399
Come, Qinxiang.

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:37.399
Get up.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.639
Let me see.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.399
Was it Zhao Senyao who did this?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.759
Thank you, Vice Minister Jing
and Madam, for stepping in.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.759
If you wish to hear a tune,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.120
I will attend to you.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.919
If not,

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.399
I must return to fix my makeup

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.360
and receive the next patron.

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.160
It's not the first time Zhao Senyao
has beaten you, is it?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.640
Master Shenguan
was treating your illness.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.440
Do you know
he died at the Zhao Residence?

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.359
The night you met him,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.279
did he say anything important to you?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.400
Sir.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.759
Vice Minister Huang has arrived.

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:32.440
Lord Huang.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.519
Lord Gao insisted I come here.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:36.400
For what purpose?

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.039
Lord Huang.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.839
This is

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.640
a selection
of the finest Nanzhao spices,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.240
prepared especially for you.

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.279
I wonder

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.759
if they suit your taste.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.200
That won't be necessary.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.440
Officials of the Ministry of Rites
have always upheld integrity.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.319
If Vice Envoy Gao
has something to say, speak plainly.

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:08.799
if it is within my ability,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.240
I will do my utmost.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.559
Very well.

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.480
Lord Huang,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.559
the court has now concluded

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.720
that our Nanzhao eminent monk
died by accident.

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:21.599
Yet his remains are still kept
by the Three Judicial Offices,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.759
which harms Nanzhao's dignity.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.000
So

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:26.599
we wish to ask you

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.839
to have the remains returned.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:33.839
That falls under the authority
of the Three Judicial Offices.

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:36.000
Commandery Prince An holds great power.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.119
I fear I cannot be of help.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.200
Vice Minister Huang,
you truly stand upright,

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:48.119
not even sparing
a glance at Nanzhao's gift.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.640
We all serve our respective courts.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.960
So I hope you will not put me
in a difficult position

00:18:58.119 --> 00:18:59.559
and grant us some convenience.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.480
If Vice Minister Huang

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:03.960
were rumored
to have certain unspeakable tastes,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.720
and such rumors reached His Majesty,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.680
it would be enough

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.920
to ruin your official future,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.799
or even cost you your life.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.319
Vice Minister Huang.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.440
Are you satisfied with this offering?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.599
As for the affairs
of the Three Judicial Offices,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.759
I will do my utmost.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.799
Still,

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.640
I cannot guarantee any outcome.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.160
Lord Huang,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.119
in the days ahead,

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:06.640
do come by more often,

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:08.839
so we may enjoy
these fragrances together.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.079
Very well.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.039
Very well.

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:32.240
Zhao Senyao was beating
Qinxiang mercilessly.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.640
He has always been indulgent,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.359
but never openly violent.

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:39.160
Yet today he was savage,

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.880
as if he harbored
a deadly hatred toward her.

00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:45.799
Qinxiang has long endured his abuse,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.799
and Master Shenguan then happened
to die suddenly at the Zhao Residence.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.920
Follow this lead

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.200
and continue the investigation.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.799
Your Highness,

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:00.480
what concerns me is that

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.279
if the truth leads
to nothing in the end,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.440
and there is no hidden scheme
behind Master Shenguan's death,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.319
then

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.680
you will be the first
to come under attack.

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:12.559
Factional strife

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.680
has always plagued officialdom.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.400
But the Three Judicial Offices act

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.000
only to safeguard the Great Tang.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.440
Being condemned by many

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.599
matters little

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.920
if the realm remains at peace.

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:23.079
Very well.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.119
Then we proceed.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.920
The Three Judicial Offices
do not rest on you alone.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.000
The heavens will not collapse.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.279
Speak.

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.599
What do you plan to do next?

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.960
Now that there are
signs something was concealed,

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:34.519
we must be thorough.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.680
You mean...

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.599
The last autopsy
was not done by Chu Chu,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.279
but by You Chen'an in her stead.

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:42.759
I will find a way to persuade Jing Yuan

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.680
to allow another examination
of Master Shenguan's body.

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:46.759
This time,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.599
Chu Chu will conduct it herself.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:51.880
So you have finally
let go of that fixation,

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.839
and will no longer
keep Chu Chu out of it.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.160
Chu Chu was right.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.640
Like any other coroner,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.519
she is a member
of the Three Judicial Offices.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.880
Since that is the case,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.640
I should

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.559
choose personnel based solely on

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.279
what best serves the case.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.359
As for their safety,

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.920
that responsibility falls to me.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.480
Your Highness.

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.240
Someone from the Ministry
of Rites is here,

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:22.799
requesting to take
Master Shenguan's body.

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:24.400
Where is His Highness?

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.359
His Highness just left

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.079
for the palace.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.279
Vice Minister Jing went with him.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.400
(Ten-Commandment Hall)

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:33.799
Your Highness.

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:35.480
I, Vice Minister of Rites, Huang Lv,

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.839
pay my respects.

00:22:37.519 --> 00:22:38.880
What brings Vice Minister Huang here?

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:41.279
I have heard
that the Three Judicial Offices

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.400
and Nanzhao have jointly signed off

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.880
on the autopsy findings.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.599
I hope Your Highness will consider
the difficulties faced by the Ministry of Rites

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:51.279
and hand Master Shenguan's
body over to me.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:54.880
Vice Minister Huang, have you
informed His Highness of this?

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:58.160
I am here by imperial command.

00:22:58.279 --> 00:22:59.559
Then do you have
His Majesty's written order?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.359
Though Your Highness
serves with the Three Judicial Offices,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.279
at the end of the day,

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:07.079
you are still a woman
of the inner quarters.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:08.920
Many matters of officialdom

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.440
cannot be made clear

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.960
in just a few words to Your Highness.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.079
So there is no written order.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200
Vice Minister Huang,
you're in such a hurry

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.680
to take Master Shenguan's body.

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:20.720
Is it because
the Nanzhao delegation is pressing,

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:22.079
and you fear His Majesty's inquiry?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.640
Since Your Highness
sees things so clearly,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.039
please do not make things difficult
for the Ministry of Rites.

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.359
If the matter is so urgent,

00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:31.799
why did Vice Minister Huang
wait until dusk to come?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.720
The Ministry
has many affairs to attend to.

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:37.799
I only just found the time.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.960
What a coincidence.

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:40.640
You happened to miss His Highness.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:43.839
With His Highness absent,

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:45.640
the body may not be moved
without authorization.

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:47.880
If you are truly anxious,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.039
you may enter the palace now
and see His Highness.

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:52.279
With a document bearing his signature,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.359
the mortuary will comply at once.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:55.480
You...

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.200
I still have pressing duties
to attend to,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.880
so I will not keep you for tea.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.000
Chen Feng.

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:00.720
See our guest out.

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:01.640
Yes.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.359
Lord Huang,

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.759
this way, please.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.540
(Ten-Commandment Hall)

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.640
(Body Preparation Room)

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.920
From today onward,
rotate shifts in three watches.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.519
No one is to enter.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.440
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:22.039
Wu Jiang.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.000
What happened?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.880
Your Highness.

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:27.480
His Highness instructed me

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:28.720
to guard the body at all costs.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.000
No one is to take it away.

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.079
I had the same thought as he did.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.559
Understood.

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:34.160
Carry on with your duties.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.119
Master Shenguan

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.240
kept his precepts pure
throughout his life.

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:17.880
After passing, where would he go?

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:21.279
To the Pure Land.

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.160
Not long ago, I heard of a legal case.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.759
But only part of it.

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.119
I was hoping you

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.079
could enlighten me.

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:36.960
Please go on.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.799
It tells of Master Danxia,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.079
who once encountered a beautiful woman

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.640
unable to cross a river.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.519
So the master carried her

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:50.119
across the river.

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.519
A fellow practitioner
rebuked the master,

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.039
saying this act

00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:57.200
broke the vow of chastity.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.160
Master Danxia replied
with just one sentence,

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:02.519
and the man attained sudden insight.

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:04.880
Master Danxia said,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.559
"I have already

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.880
let go of that woman.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.839
Why are you still holding on to her?"

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:17.519
It seems that all things in this world

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:20.440
are shaped by karma,

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.359
with no absolute right or wrong.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.599
Everything

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.519
begins with intention.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.000
As the Sixth Patriarch said,

00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:35.440
Bodhi has no tree.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.319
The bright mirror has no stand.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.880
Originally there is nothing,

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.160
so where could dust alight?

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:53.720
I understand

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.400
what you mean.

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:57.160
I also know

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.119
what you seek.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.559
Amitabha.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.599
This is osmanthus wine
brewed by Consort Hui herself.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:36.160
Let me

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.079
offers a toast to Your Majesty.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480
These past days,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.920
those old men have been filing
complaints about you nonstop.

00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:51.960
Look at these memorials.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.319
I rise early and retire late,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.599
and half of it is thanks to you.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.200
I

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.079
acknowledge my fault.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.559
You are frail,

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:09.160
and you never drink.

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:11.039
Why today?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.599
Because I am at fault.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.440
Speak.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.680
Are you prepared?

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.039
I ask that Chu Chu

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:46.880
re-examine Master Shenguan.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.359
Xiao Jinyu,

00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:57.680
if you pursue this further,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.359
even I cannot protect you.

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:01.039
Do you understand?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:03.839
I

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:06.480
understand.

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.359
Careful on the turn.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.279
Do not bump His Highness.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.519
Mind His Highness's hand.

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:20.119
Move.

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:22.400
Steady.

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:26.279
No rush.

00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:26.880
Steady.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.200
Your Highness.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.039
Your Highness.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.200
Stop.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.799
One, two, three.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.720
Wu Jiang.

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:38.519
What happened to His Highness?

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.480
His Highness...

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.000
His Highness drank
much with His Majesty.

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:43.319
Before he passed out,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.640
he repeatedly instructed me

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:47.759
to personally deliver

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.359
His Majesty's written approval to you.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:53.240
I will perform the autopsy
on Master Shenguan?

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:54.759
His Majesty agreed?

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:59.079
My turn now, right?

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.920
You said my skull looks good.

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.319
The best...

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.000
You said it...

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:09.319
You're the best-looking.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:09.799
Come on.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.400
Get up first.

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:10.960
Come.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.559
Turn around. Don't look.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.240
Chu Chu likes corpses the most.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.400
I am a corpse.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.279
Chu Chu, you like me the most.

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:32.039
Yes.

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.279
I like you the most.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.519
Look at me.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.440
The floor is cold.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.400
Get up first.

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:44.119
Wu Jiang.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.119
So it's good news.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.039
Come help.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.599
Come.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:49.920
One, two, three.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.559
Move.

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:51.599
Careful.

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:52.119
Here.

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:52.880
Support him.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.880
Slowly.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.400
Here.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.559
Careful.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.960
Watch out.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.119
Careful. Don't hit his head.

00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:05.559
Slowly.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.440
Push him in.

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:12.640
Further in.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:13.960
Alright.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.599
He looks slim,

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:17.920
but he's heavy when drunk.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:19.359
I'm exhausted.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.400
Wu Jiang.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.000
Go prepare the hangover remedy.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.359
Chen Feng, get water for his feet.

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.240
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.400
Chu Chu.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.119
Then I will be on my way.

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:39.519
Call for me if anything comes up.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.039
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:47.759
It hurts.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.480
Hurts?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.680
Where does it hurt?

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:51.440
My chest.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680
Chest?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.559
You only had a few cups of wine, right?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.759
You do not want me anymore.

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:58.680
My chest hurts.

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:02.440
Your Highness,
you are blaming me instead.

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:07.279
Still sharp even when drunk.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.359
You stay silent
when it is hard to answer.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.519
When have I ever abandoned you?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.480
After drinking so much,

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:14.519
it is only natural your chest hurts.

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.160
Chest hurts...

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.480
Wine...

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.359
Autopsy...

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:26.599
Your Highness.

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:27.880
The sobering soup is ready.

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:30.200
You came just in time.

00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:33.759
Do remember to drink it later.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.279
Be good.

00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:38.720
Take good care of His Highness.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.400
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:45.480
Is Her Highness angry?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.279
How would I know?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.119
When His Highness wakes tomorrow,

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:50.400
and remembers tonight,

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:52.799
will he silence us both?

00:32:52.839 --> 00:32:53.799
Say one more word,

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:55.359
and I will silence you first.

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.000
Go wash His Highness's feet.

00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:20.440
How did I get back last night?

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.960
Wu Jiang and Chen Feng led the way,

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:25.079
I carried you back myself.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.839
Nearly broke my back.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.720
Why are you still here so early?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.079
You really went all in this time.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:32.279
It is this late
and you are still not sober.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:36.680
Your father's trick really worked.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.079
Drink yourself senseless first.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.759
That way even His Majesty

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.599
cannot press you too hard.

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:45.279
Clever.

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:49.279
Just that the aftermath is brutal.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.759
What are you laughing at?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.440
That aftermath

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:03.079
is something only
our Chu Chu could handle.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.759
Chu Chu came to take care
of me last night?

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.319
Be precise.

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.400
It was not her tending to you.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.039
You were the one clinging
to her and refusing to let go.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.079
You do not remember it at all?

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.599
Then do you remember

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.440
lying on the floor
pretending to be a corpse?

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.559
You told Chu Chu

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:26.519
that she likes corpses most
and begged her to examine you.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.440
You are making things up, right?

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:31.719
I would not dare.

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:32.920
Everyone heard it.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.239
Where is Chu Chu?

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:39.960
The Princess Consort spent
the whole night examining bodies.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.039
She is still in the mortuary.

00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:43.280
Have the kitchen prepare
some salted porridge.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.239
Save it for the Princess Consort.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:45.840
Yes.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.079
I stayed out all night.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.480
Leng Yue must be worried. I should go.

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:52.960
Get lost.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.719
Vice Minister, do not go.

00:34:57.239 --> 00:34:58.719
I am never drinking again.

00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:02.880
Good morning, Madam.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.079
Mengchun,

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.320
why have these plants been moved here?

00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:12.440
They are not usually
kept in this courtyard.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.320
While you and Master Jing
were out last night,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.079
a petty thief broke into the residence.

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:17.199
The courtyard was left in a mess.

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.559
The servants
are putting things back in order.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.480
Did the thief steal anything?

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:23.480
Please do not worry.
Everything has been checked.

00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:24.639
Nothing is missing,

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:25.320
and no one was hurt.

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:28.559
Only a flowerpot by the wall was broken.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.920
Most likely crushed
when the thief landed there.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.079
Take me to see

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.159
where the thief came in.

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:34.719
Yes.

00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:35.800
This way, please.

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:45.800
It looks like

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.840
the footprint is about
the same size as my lord's.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.840
The flowerpot...

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:57.360
Lady Jing,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.119
this is just an ordinary plant.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.239
There is nothing unusual about it.

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:01.360
Then you may keep it.

00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:06.280
Madam.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.840
I was going to report to Your Highness

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.159
that the autopsy is complete,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.079
and that we can investigate
the Zhao Residence again.

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:25.760
Since Your Highness is still asleep,

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.119
I will go on my own.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.239
Already awake?

00:36:35.519 --> 00:36:36.199
I am.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.400
The one down there,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.760
you were drunk yesterday,

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.079
spouting nonsense.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.440
Now that you are sober,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.960
you have nothing to say?

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.719
I was wrong.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.679
In the statements you read every day,

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:02.599
people rarely say much?

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.840
Last night was my fault.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.760
You spoke vaguely,

00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:10.800
which shows

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:11.840
a lack of sincerity.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.639
I lost my composure when drunk,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.719
and caused you trouble.

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:17.159
I am sorry.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:24.880
I...

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:27.119
I should not have decided on my own

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.480
to keep you away from this case.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.400
What I resented was myself.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.599
Since our marriage,

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.840
I have failed
to shield you from hardship.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.679
Instead, I brought storms to your side.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.440
I feared that, in time,

00:37:42.559 --> 00:37:44.280
you might regret choosing me.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.639
Chu Chu.

00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:50.000
I am sorry.

00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:53.199
Why must it be you alone who shields me?

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.480
If these storms

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:57.719
are already part of who you are,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.360
then it means

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.599
you were standing in the wind and rain

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:03.920
long before they ever reached me.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.519
People say husband
and wife are paired wings,

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.880
branches grown together.

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:11.360
How could one stand in the storm

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.119
while the other stays outside it?

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.599
Unless

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.760
you never meant to be my partner at all.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.840
Of course I did.

00:38:21.159 --> 00:38:23.400
But all I have brought you

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.599
are rumors and trouble.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.480
You treat me so well

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.679
that I no longer know what to do.

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:40.159
You are always like this.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.800
You forget your own kindness

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.079
the moment you give it.

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:44.639
Yet every kindness shown to you,

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.519
you carry it carefully in your heart.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.159
But that is all right.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.480
I have kept

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.400
your kindness clearly in my heart.

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.639
No one can twist right and wrong.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.599
Thank you.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.599
The dignified Commandery Prince An

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.559
left without a word to live separately.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:11.800
Tell me,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.360
what crime is that?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.599
I admit my fault.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.519
It will never happen again.

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:21.960
Are you sober now?

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:24.000
My mind is clear.

00:39:24.719 --> 00:39:25.880
As if reborn.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.559
Then there is something important
I must tell you.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.280
What is it?

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.280
The cause of Master Shenguan's death

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.760
is indeed suspicious.
