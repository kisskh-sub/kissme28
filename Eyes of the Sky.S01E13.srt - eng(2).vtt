WEBVTT

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.840
I didn't expect it to go so smoothly this time.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.679
Extraction is almost complete.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.319
Who am I?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.239
Master, you are Huo Ming.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.239
Who are you?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.159
Master, I am Xiao Cang.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.640
Don't touch me.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.040
Memory extraction complete.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.879
He's a vegetable now.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.280
These are the nanobots I brought out.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.280
But the control program is missing.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.480
If they could control human organs...

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.680
Like deeply stimulating the hippocampus...

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.879
...to overclock the human body...

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.000
I could break free from Mind-Bender's brainwashing.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.799
Got it. Nanobots.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.920
Activate Dr. Shen Meng's nanobots.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.480
His hand just moved.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280
Impossible. Memory extraction is complete.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.240
No one can wake up from that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.680
Master.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.960
Your memory has been fully retrieved.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.360
Xiao Cang.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.240
Nanobots are repairing my new functions.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.960
Super networking mode activated.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.159
I can control all electronic devices

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.439
within five hundred meters.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.280
Impossible.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.479
I thought it was impossible too.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.360
But thanks to what you did...

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.840
...my system actually upgraded.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.840
It feels pretty good. Thanks.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.680
Professor Ning.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.039
This car goes zero to a hundred in 2.7 seconds.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.639
It's less than a meter away from you.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.120
To run you over...

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.639
...wouldn't even take 0.1 seconds.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.199
What... what do you want to do?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.879
Did you forget something?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.759
You haven't given me the password yet.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.719
The password better be real.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.960
I really don't want to extract your memory.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.520
Professor Ning.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.599
As a top-tier scientist...

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.000
...you made a deal with Mind-Bender.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120
You betrayed not only trust...

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.919
...but the baseline of humanity.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.960
No matter how great your scientific achievements...

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.639
...you'll always be a despicable scoundrel.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.120
Fine, I'll give you the password now.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.879
Every researcher has a password.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.879
Then Fu Xue must have one too.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.199
Boss, this kid had his memory extracted.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.519
How could he still wake up?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.519
We went through so much to get Professor Ning...

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.680
...to collude with Mind-Bender.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.360
Thought we could take him down.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.839
Didn't expect him to upgrade instead.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.879
Boss.

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.120
This kid is probably going to get stronger.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.639
We need to use more ruthless methods.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.600
What's the rush?

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.120
We still have a trump card.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.360
Everything is going according to plan.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.279
Although we couldn't kill Huo Ming...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.560
...at least we've located Mind-Bender.

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.079
I'm going to meet Mind-Bender.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.120
And discuss cooperation with him.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.079
Gently.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.439
Your erector spinae tension is off the charts.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:34.480
You coming to see me today...

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.079
...isn't just for a chat, is it?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.240
You know why I'm here.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.240
Keep going.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.240
I can probably guess.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.199
However...

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.040
I won't give it to you easily again.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.959
You men...

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.120
...when you get things too easily...

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.160
...you don't cherish them.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.040
Name your conditions.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.120
What? Unwilling?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.560
I know my limits.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.920
But you, don't accidentally cross the line.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.399
What does that mean?

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.959
Chu Chen went to see Professor Ning.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.000
And Professor Ning turned traitor.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.720
He came to see you too.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.759
Yes, he did come to see me.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:10.959
What did he want with you?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.720
Want to know?

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.160
That's why I'm here.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
Help me apply lipstick.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.720
With your mouth.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.720
You're about to cross the line.

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.600
Just a red card.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600
The password is inside.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.920
Chu Chen and I are hedging our bets.

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:22.920
Take a guess.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:30.079
I will definitely win.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.840
Name your terms.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.879
Right now, I need

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.519
the passwords of all the researchers.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.559
You're in no position to negotiate.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.840
Is that so?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.919
Your real body is right here.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.159
Shall I send someone to pay you a visit?

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.720
I need to see the Cang Qiong drive first.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.759
Before I give you the passwords.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:06.240
I will get the hard drive.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.639
Why should I trust you?

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.200
You have no choice but to trust me.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.559
What are you doing here?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.120
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.799
Or let you interfere with my life.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:21.559
Strictly business.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:24.159
I found three of the passwords.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.559
You can try them out.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.399
I'll have the hard drive sent over.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.159
Before we check the passwords,

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.799
I want to show you some photos.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.279
What do these photos prove?

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:39.320
Can't he associate with these people?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.919
It's just a blurry view of a back.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.360
What does that prove?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.919
It proves that he collaborated with Mind-Bender

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.320
and Professor Ning.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.159
It's a trap they set for me.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:50.120
That is just your speculation.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.399
After all these years,

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.960
I trust Chu Chen's character.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.120
Yun.

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.039
Chu Chen.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.919
I thought you didn't trust him.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.120
Perfect time for a confrontation.

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.320
Mr. Huo is here, too.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:08.639
I hope I'm not interrupting.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.320
Of course not.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.440
We were just waiting for you.

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.759
Are you suspecting me?

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.919
Before I went to see Professor Ning,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.440
you went to see him too, didn't you?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.600
Actually, I've known Professor Ning for a long time.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.600
He approached me about his research before.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.639
Professor Ning and Mind-Bender's collaboration...

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.120
was facilitated by you, wasn't it?

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.960
Why would they collude?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.399
Besides, this photo doesn't even show a face.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Is it really me?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.639
Chu Chen, you can really talk your way out of anything.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.960
Huo Ming, enough.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.639
Chu Chen, why are you here?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.519
Yun.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.399
Actually, I came here today

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.600
to propose to you.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.039
Marry me.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.919
Cheers.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720
Once Cang Qiong is cracked and we find the truth,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.840
I will marry you.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:37.480
We already have three passwords.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.320
I will definitely help you, Yun.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.440
The takeout hasn't arrived yet.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.200
Don't be in such a rush to leave.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.840
How's the red wine? Is it good?

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:37.720
It's quite good.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.039
Too bad you won't get the chance to drink it.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.919
No, no, no.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.960
How would I dare drink a liar's wine?

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.600
I got the hard drive.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:48.960
I'm guessing you and Mind-Bender

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.120
have already reached an agreement.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.960
If Lin Yun finds out about all this,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.320
what will she think of you?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.200
She won't believe

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.159
a word of your fabrications.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.120
No, I believe him.
