WEBVTT

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.681
If they knew I was coming here,
they could've told me to wear sneakers.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.393
They told me to get all dressed up,
and for what?

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.395
My legs are killing me.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.313
Damn it.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.608
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, your mic's going live.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.860
Ah, fuck. Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.696
Please hold the action cam upright.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.411
Is this good?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.623
These heels will be ruined.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.668
Hey, is my manager there?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.545
Mu-hee, I'm listening.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.630
Were these shoes a gift or a loan?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.133
Those are on loan.
Please be careful with them.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.468
All right. Okay.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:49.317
Please track Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
just like that.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.961
Drone one, push in
for a tighter front shot on Ms. Cha.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.380
Park, is in-ear interpretation ready?

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.798
Yes, we're good to go.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.715
Mr. Joo.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.384
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.469
Add some inserts here and there.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.139
Ms. Cho?

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.269
Mr. Joo, are you ready?

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.688
Yes, I'm all set too.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.242
Wow, we're so high up.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.913
So, back in the day, all this belonged
to the king who lived in this castle.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:49.794
Imagine standing here, looking out,
knowing all of this land was yours.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.464
How many acres is all this?

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.843
You can't lean on that. Step back.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.595
What's that?

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.681
It's not like you
to speak up like this, Mr. Joo.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.059
Are you worried about me?
What, in case I blow away?

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.437
It's on the sign in front of you.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.109
"Do not lean or climb on the railing."

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.861
I simply translated it.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.325
What about those who don't speak Italian?
It should also be in English.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.620
It is also in English.
You just couldn't read it.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.496
I know English.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.374
I can read my ABCs. Here it is.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.376
That's German.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.003
It's in English below that.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.507
I only mixed them up
because they look so similar.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.469
People who can tell the difference
are the weird ones.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.932
Today's the last day of filming.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.519
I wrote a farewell message
for Hiro in Japanese.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.355
No need to interpret that for me.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.232
All right.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.610
Now, tracking Hiro.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.795
"It's a beautiful day."

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:17.715
"I chose this spot for our final shoot.
I'm glad the weather's cooperating."

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:24.514
"Let's go that way.
The view from over there is even better."

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.766
Have you been here before?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.399
"I once filmed a series here,
when I was new to acting."

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.569
"I made so many mistakes
that I still remember my lines clearly."

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.114
"I was such a terrible actor then."

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.198
Really?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.618
How terrible, exactly?
Now I'm curious. Is it on YouTube?

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.871
Please don't look it up.
I really don't want to remember.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.581
What was it again?

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.542
"Cringewar"?

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:54.669
"Cringeworth"?

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.045
"Cringeworth"?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.630
Oh, cringeworthy?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:58.798
That's it!

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:00.758
- Cringeworthy?
- Cringeworthy!

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.135
That's amazing.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.762
They seem closer compared to
when we started shooting.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.680
Don't they?

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:09.726
Now that the trip's almost over,
they're practically besties!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:29.996
"Beautiful."

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.789
"So much that I can't look away."

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.583
I agree.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.422
We saw so many beautiful places
while filming.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.551
I'm a little bummed that it's over.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.096
I agree.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.726
I would like…

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.647
to keep seeing you.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.905
I think the reason every moment

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.657
of our journey has been beautiful…

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.829
is that you

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.083
were a part of the scenery.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.932
What did he just say?

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.392
Can you interpret…

00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.644
Is he saying goodbye?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.355
Should I give my farewell message now?

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:41.317
Mr. Joo,

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.404
if you were too shocked
to interpret what I just said,

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.448
can you just pass on

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.450
these words to her?

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.812
Mr. Joo, what's he saying?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.858
I can't reply
unless you pass on his message.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.572
I guess your farewell message
won't be necessary.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.199
Let me interpret his words.

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:32.326
He asked me to tell you…

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.256
"I really like you, Cha Mu-hee."

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.397
Did you hear that?

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.025
Did the message get through?

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:24.754
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:29.509
JAPAN

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.436
Here's the forecast across the country
for Monday, April 8th.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.980
It looks like
more areas will see sunshine today.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.067
Rain is expected
in southern Kanto in the morning,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.152
but skies will gradually clear.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.572
1 YEAR AGO, APRIL

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:13.302
"Let's hear from Mr. Kim Young-hwan,
who is well-loved in Japan too."

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:19.267
I am elated to bring my latest novel
to my Japanese readers.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:23.938
I hope all of you enjoy it.

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.398
Thank you.

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.502
They'll now take questions from the press.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.713
You had a big turnout.

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.174
See? That's how popular I am.
Only you look down on me.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.302
When have I ever looked down on you?

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:59.140
Anyway, thanks
for putting up with this old man

00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:01.267
and interpreting the past few days.

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:03.769
Here.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.522
The publisher gave it to me.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.609
The Japanese are great
at this sort of thing.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.402
Why would you give me your gift?

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:15.656
A Japanese literary magazine is coming
to Seoul next month to interview me.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.117
I'd like you to interpret for me then too.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.954
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I won't be in Seoul then.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.499
Right, you said you're going to Spain,
didn't you?

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.711
Yes, I probably won't be back in Korea
for a few months once I leave.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.755
Oh no, that won't do.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.968
You're the only one who can make sense
of my nonsense and interpret it.

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:39.096
Why not delay your Spain trip a little?

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:43.225
So dragging a busy guy to Japan
and making him work wasn't enough?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.186
Aren't you being too shameless?

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:50.650
Then why don't we swing by a sushi bar
before the airport for a drink?

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.527
Mr. Kim, please.
Cut down on your drinking.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:56.322
You kept mixing up
the characters in your novel.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:11:00.576
The name of the heroine's first husband
is Nam Hyeon-su, not Park In-cheol.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.245
Yeong-suk's first husband is Nam Hyeon-su?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.247
You're the one who wrote the novel.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.917
I was at a loss
while interpreting there, seriously.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.046
You handled it just fine.
So fine that it's my treat. Let's go.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:15.466
You can treat me next time.
I have somewhere to visit while I'm here.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.509
Where?

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:20.805
Heading somewhere nice on your own?
Meeting someone?

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.517
- Do you have a date?
- Have a safe trip back, Mr. Kim.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.186
Oh, so it is a date, then?

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.523
Wow, and here I thought
you had no game whatsoever.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.317
If it's a date,
share those cookies with her.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.652
Nice and sweet!

00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:48.082
To transfer to the Enoden Line,
first exit the JR Line using your ticket.

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:51.085
Once you exit, turn right,
and you'll see the central square.

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:52.628
Keep walking past the square,

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:56.006
and when you see this sign,
go through the gates to the left.

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:03.556
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:23.743
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.578
You're out of Korean leaflets.

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.205
Oh, sorry. We'll restock them.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.123
Thank you.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.737
Paolo, stop messing around, please.

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.032
It's all right.
He didn't do it on purpose.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.201
Wow! You speak Italian.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.996
We've never met a Japanese person
who speaks Italian.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:35.124
I'm not Japanese. I'm Korean.

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.585
- Really?
- Oh, Korean?

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.421
- Have you ever been to Italy?
- Yes, I have.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.591
"Hashtag, Momo-chan Ramen."

00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:45.342
"Hashtag, a fresh start."

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.136
"Hashtag, grateful for you."

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.430
I must say, your Italian is very good.

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:53.183
"Hashtag, will make you happy."

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.038
Excuse me.

00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.749
The food is hot. Here you go.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:17.917
Thank you.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.668
Let me know if you need anything.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.337
Can kids eat this?

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.214
Yes, but kids might find it a bit spicy.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.257
Welcome.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.343
Please sit anywhere you'd like.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.600
Ma'am?

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.561
Please.

00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:46.028
Excuse me.

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.072
Here's our menu.

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:58.457
Are you Momo-chan,
the owner of Momo-chan Ramen?

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:06.674
Yes.

00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:17.434
Okay, one Momo-chan Ramen coming right up.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.103
Excuse me.

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:22.856
I would recommend that you order… this.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.942
Okay, thank you.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.947
She looked older in the photos.

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:49.633
I am here in search of a Korean man
who wishes to have

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.261
a fresh start with you, Momo-chan.

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.654
It sounds too much like a news anchor.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.491
Isn't there an option
to change the tone of voice?

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.909
Make it a little tougher?

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:26.420
Oh, he's Chinese?

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.672
I thought he was Korean.

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.594
First, let's give you a female voice.

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.680
I need you to interpret well.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.559
Can this app swear too?

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:45.898
Fuck.

00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:51.028
Fuck.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.162
KakaoTalk?

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.372
You're Korean?

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.090
You understood everything?

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.510
You did, didn't you?

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:17.429
I happened to hear.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.516
You were eavesdropping
while pretending to be Chinese.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.559
When did I ever pretend to be Chinese?

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.146
You were pretending
to read that Chinese pamphlet.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.525
I wasn't pretending. I was reading it.
I don't just read the Chinese one.

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.195
I always read the English,
French, and Italian ones.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.405
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.949
What are you, Papago?

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:37.866
Look here, I--

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.992
Paolo!

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:40.911
Paolo!

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:43.497
Our son is sick. Please call an ambulance.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.790
We don't speak Japanese.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.125
What happened to him?

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.251
He has an allergy.

00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:50.462
Something in his snack earlier
must have triggered a reaction.

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:51.630
An ambulance, please.

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:54.383
Please tell them
a boy is having an allergic reaction.

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.300
Okay.

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.010
What snack did he eat?

00:18:57.761 --> 00:18:58.720
Here.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.181
This one.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.433
You'd better take this with you
to the hospital.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.434
Okay.

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:05.853
I called an ambulance.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.230
But the alleyway here is narrow.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.023
It may be a while before they arrive.

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:14.611
She says the alley's too narrow,
so the ambulance might take a while.

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:17.489
- I'll carry him to the main street.
- Okay, honey.

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:19.116
I'll carry him.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.118
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.789
Tell the ambulance to meet us
at the main street entrance.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:26.707
Okay.

00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:30.711
I'll watch your things.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:32.171
Okay, thank you.

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:41.346
So he really is Papago.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:47.936
Excuse me.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:49.479
Excuse me.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:58.030
I let the paramedics know
what's going on with Paolo.

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:02.618
Give me a call if you need
additional interpretation at the hospital.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:03.660
Thank you so much.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.121
- Please take care of him.
- Got it.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.585
Turning left soon. Please be careful.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:24.806
Thank you.

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.688
Can you help me too?

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.025
I have an emergency too.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.653
I was going to use Papago,

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.322
but I think a human voice
will be better than AI

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.908
at conveying my feelings
in a more authentic way.

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:45.494
I don't want to interpret
a sordid lovers' quarrel.

00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:49.331
I knew it. You heard everything.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.166
- Fuck.
- F…

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.584
You heard that too, right?

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.211
I happened to hear.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:01.260
Then you'll know I'm here to beg
a man who's starting over to take me back.

00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:03.387
Please help me.

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:05.472
If he rejects me via Papago,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.017
I'll feel unbearably pathetic.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:15.983
Fine. I'll help you.

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.735
But I'm not interpreting any profanity.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.412
She says Mr. Kim Yu-jin isn't here
but in Tokyo.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:30.205
He's not here?

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.375
Or maybe he saw me and hid.

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.795
I feel like
the two of them are lying to me.

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:40.215
So what? You want me to tell her that?

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:42.426
Forget it.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.929
Just ask her when he'll be back.

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:57.691
She says she'll call over his girlfriend.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:21:59.860
Excuse me?

00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:02.321
Eiko, can you come out here for a moment?

00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.950
Is she really the one
he's starting over with?

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.286
It is!

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:15.208
{\an8}He even posted her photo on Instagram,
calling it "a fresh start." Look.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:16.668
{\an8}It's her, isn't it?

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.472
You guessed wrong.

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.098
No way…

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:34.561
I naturally thought
it was the younger woman in the photo.

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.786
Could you just ask her

00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:52.913
how far along she is?

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.087
Seven months, she says.

00:23:02.005 --> 00:23:04.257
He broke up with me three months ago.

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.300
Seven months…

00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:09.262
I must have been crazy.

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:11.640
That absolute douchebag!

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:15.977
Excuse me.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.816
Is she Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.026
Probably.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.947
I have something I'd like to say to her.
Could you pass it on for me?

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:32.911
Excuse me!

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:34.746
Excuse me!

00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:41.962
Can you type this in Japanese for me?
"The Korean chef here is a dirtbag."

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:45.090
Hashtag two-timer,
hashtag cheater, hashtag manwh…

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:49.386
Die. I'm going to curse you!
I hope you go out of business!

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:53.098
As with profanity, I don't translate
curses wishing ill on others.

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.642
I'd rather not get involved,

00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:58.770
but the woman asked me to pass on
a message, so I'll do that much.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:05.652
The father of my child

00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:08.029
is my ex-husband, not Yu-jin.

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:12.451
Even though I knew it was selfish,

00:24:13.243 --> 00:24:15.537
I wanted to rely on his kindness.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:22.085
But if Ms. Cha Mu-hee
is able to change his mind,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.338
I'd happily let him go.

00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:30.719
She told me to take him?
Could you have misheard?

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.554
I passed on what I heard.

00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:34.848
What's her deal?

00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.809
Is she mocking me?
Like "Take him if you can"?

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:38.977
How did it seem to you?

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.645
I just relayed the message.

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:43.064
No, I mean,
do you really think she meant it?

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.441
It's too suspicious!

00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:46.693
She's in a rough spot,
but she's being nice!

00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:50.822
I only pass along the words people say,
not judge what kind of person they are.

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:54.159
Fine. We'll go back together and see.
Let's go, Mr. Papago.

00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:55.410
That's enough!

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.537
Ms. Cha… Mu-hee?

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:04.044
If you'd broken up, it's not betrayal.
And it's not his baby, so he didn't cheat.

00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:06.213
They're just two people--

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:09.090
In love… is what you're saying.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.552
- That pisses me off.
- Exactly.

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:16.348
Go any further,
and you become the bad guy.

00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.351
Whether I end up the bad guy
or a crazy bitch, I'll deal with it.

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:21.520
- I just need you to interpret.
- I refuse.

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:26.441
Usually, if you want to act bad or crazy,
the act of destruction itself

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.528
is enough to convey
just how pissed off you really are.

00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:32.989
No interpretation needed.
Or use a language that's universal.

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:37.494
Best of luck.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.581
You said you don't judge,
so why am I the bad guy?

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.754
So their love is pure and sweet,

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:50.257
but mine has to end a mess, with this?

00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:58.765
He told me he was breaking up with me
and vanished.

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:02.143
He's done it before, so I just waited.

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:05.814
But three months later,
he posted a photo saying "a fresh start."

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.482
That's why I came here to find him.

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.779
It may seem desperate and pathetic,
but this is love too.

00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:15.574
I don't want to end it with this.

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:23.832
Help me end things
with a shred of dignity.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:29.004
Please translate my love too.

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:32.924
I beg you.

00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.556
Hey, Yu-jin.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.726
Yes, everything is fine here.

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.395
You'll be back tonight?

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.608
No, I wouldn't want you to hurry.

00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:52.068
Come back tomorrow as scheduled.

00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:53.653
Yes.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.781
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:27:03.997 --> 00:27:06.833
Sorry, but we're closed…

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.427
I appreciate your kind heart.

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.304
But I came back

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:21.598
because there's something
I want to ask you.

00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:32.150
While I was dating him,

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:35.236
he'd go off the grid from time to time,

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:37.822
for anything from a week
to over two months.

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:40.950
Was he with you during those times?

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.668
So he was.

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:54.506
So he really did cheat.
He really did betray me.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:06.643
She said he comforted and helped her
in her time of need.

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:10.897
You shouldn't sugarcoat what he did.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.191
What, was he helping the needy?
Is she a beggar?

00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:16.111
If pity is what made him stay,
that's like begging to be loved.

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:21.199
I'll take that as angry self-talk
and leave those words untranslated.

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:24.285
You said you wanted
to keep your dignity intact.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:35.797
Still, he always found his way back to me.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:40.802
I guess he won't be able to
now that you're a soon-to-be single mom.

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:44.264
Not that I'd take him back if he did.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:50.854
Since you won't translate profanity,
let's go with some words of encouragement.

00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:56.776
It may be love gained from misfortune,

00:28:58.445 --> 00:28:59.904
but I hope you're happy.

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.084
She wants you to hear her out.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:20.759
Actually, Yu-jin and I were dating
when he was studying in Japan.

00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:25.430
But his heart was stolen by another woman.

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:33.188
She was abandoned by her family

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:36.858
and had no one to turn to,
helpless in a miserable situation.

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.360
It was as if

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:45.366
she were the tragic heroine of a movie,
weighed down by a burden of misery.

00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:48.620
Every time, I would try to make him stay,

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:52.665
but he still left,
saying he couldn't leave her alone.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:59.214
Who is she talking about?

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.220
That woman is you.

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.390
What did she just say?

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.185
What did she say?

00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:16.147
The one who used their misery to be loved

00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:18.608
is you.

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:26.825
Even after realizing her man betrayed her,
she still came all this way.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:32.080
She must have been really lonely
to throw away her pride like this.

00:30:34.457 --> 00:30:36.751
- Hey.
- Don't say a word. I got the gist.

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.258
I have no intention
of understanding this woman's words

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.718
and making the face she wants to see.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.220
Then what do you want to do?

00:30:48.763 --> 00:30:49.764
I don't know.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.184
But I think I'm about to cry.

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:59.190
If I end up crying in front of that woman,
I'll die of humiliation.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.710
Then stay like this,
and I'll sort things out.

00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:20.753
With as much dignity as possible.

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:25.216
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.176
She and I are traveling together.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.429
We just dropped by to say hello.

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:32.765
Sorry? The two of you
are traveling together?

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:37.896
We brought a gift from Tokyo.

00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:43.484
She was just trying to be polite,
yet you have been incredibly rude.

00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:48.031
What you just said will stay with me.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.826
I won't pass along any words
that may hurt her.

00:31:57.123 --> 00:31:59.375
If you're better now, let's go.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.883
Thank you so much for your help today.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.764
- In case I got anything on you earlier.
- I'm fine.

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.185
That gift looked pricey.
How much was it? I'll pay.

00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:00.395
It was gifted to me too.

00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.480
Really?

00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:05.316
Still, I feel really bad.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.946
Should I treat you to a meal?
We both skipped lunch.

00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:12.907
I'm really okay.

00:33:16.035 --> 00:33:17.704
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:21.624
Take care.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.423
About today.

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:32.468
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:35.972
Enjoy your trip.

00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:41.519
Thank you.

00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:53.656
She still came all this way.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:58.786
She must have been really lonely
to throw away her pride like this.

00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:04.709
- Yes, thanks.
- Thank you.

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.932
A woman weighed down
by a burden of misery?

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.644
Doesn't seem that way to me.

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.566
Here you go.

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:31.319
Thanks.

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:04.143
Excuse me?

00:35:05.394 --> 00:35:07.897
- I forgot to give you your phone back.
- What is it now?

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.067
- You just got a call from a foreigner.
- Right.

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:14.487
Yes, hello.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.158
My son is fine, thanks to your help.
Thank you so much.

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.868
I'm glad to hear that.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.704
We'd like to give you a gift as thanks.

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:26.124
There's no need.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.875
We had a dinner reservation,

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:31.671
but we won't be able to go
as we need to stay at the hospital.

00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:33.756
The reservation is for two people.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.302
If the person who answered is a friend
of yours, you could go with her.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.392
Right, friend…

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:48.187
The reservation was hard to get,
and it's already paid for.

00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.398
We'd love for you to go.

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.944
Okay, then. I will.

00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:56.445
Thank you very much.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.574
Yes. Okay, thank you.

00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.159
Goodbye.

00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:10.126
That was Italian, wasn't it?

00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:11.752
Yes.

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.505
It must be that kid from earlier.
Is he okay?

00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:18.009
Thankfully, he's recovering.

00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:19.844
Thank goodness.

00:36:20.803 --> 00:36:24.140
And thank goodness
I didn't take off with your phone.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.975
Today's a lucky day.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:35.860
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.988
What are you going to do now? Any plans?

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:42.825
I've already done what I came here to do.
As you saw.

00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:43.784
Why?

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:46.370
Then would you like to join me for dinner?

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:55.171
- Earlier, you said you didn't want to.
- I never said that.

00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:56.714
I simply didn't see a need to.

00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.091
So what's changed?

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:03.471
That Italian family treated me to dinner.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:06.432
It's for two people,
and it'd be a waste to go by myself.

00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:08.935
That would be a waste.
Is it at an expensive place?

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:10.394
Probably.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.651
Then I'll come and do you a favor
as my thanks.

00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:24.158
I'm the one doing you a favor,
so why act like it's the other way around?

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.368
Oh please.

00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:28.955
Good food is never as good or as filling
when eaten alone.

00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:31.958
- Let's go. Should we take a cab?
- The reservation is at 7:00.

00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:40.883
Then should we meet
outside the restaurant at 7:00?

00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:46.722
Let's hang out until then.

00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:48.849
If you're okay with that.

00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:52.228
What should we do until then?

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.608
Well, this is a tourist spot,

00:37:58.192 --> 00:37:59.402
so let's go sightseeing.

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.240
I know it's a bit late,

00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:06.450
but what's your name?

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.576
Joo Ho-jin.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.328
Nice to meet you, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.331
I'm Cha Mu-hee.

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:14.875
Yes, I know.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:28.931
We're heading to Enoshima next. Off we go!

00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.401
NA JIN-SUK

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.410
You're an actor?

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.120
So you're a celebrity?

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.207
Not every celebrity is famous.

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:57.001
That only applies

00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.712
to the top 5%, I suppose.

00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:05.259
But you can totally look me up online.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.805
What? Right.

00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:15.853
Wow, you've been in a lot of stuff.

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:20.149
You were in the movie The Crooks?
I've seen that.

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.070
I bet you're wondering
which scenes I was in.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:27.114
I get it. I only appeared
for a split second.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.618
I felt embarrassed
to include it in my filmography,

00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:34.372
but my agent called the search engine
and urged them to add it.

00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:37.958
Either way, over ten million people
saw a movie you were in.

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.711
So what? Nobody knows I was in it.

00:39:43.422 --> 00:39:47.718
There might be fireworks and celebrations,
but the festival isn't for me.

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:51.180
It's only for the people in the limelight.

00:39:53.849 --> 00:39:55.393
Like that woman said,

00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:58.270
I'm an unlucky actress
who's never seen success.

00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:01.774
If she's right,
you'll be successful from now on.

00:40:04.985 --> 00:40:09.990
If a man who's drawn to misfortune
has left you,

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.494
that must mean
happiness is all that awaits you.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.546
You're good at interpreting,
but even better at reframing things.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.653
It said "top-ranked."
A little further this way.

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:55.786
A NEW START. A FESTIVAL WITH FIREWORKS!
WITH #PAPAGO #GRATEFUL_FOR_YOU

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.334
Aren't you gonna take any photos?

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.462
Don't you have Instagram?

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:07.506
I do, but I rarely post.

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:12.136
I have 9,989 followers.

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.388
A shame, isn't it?

00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:16.640
What is?

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.143
Just a few more, and I'd be at 10,000.

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.770
I just can't seem to hit it.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.523
You want me to follow you?

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.360
Come on, it's not much to ask.
Let's be mutuals.

00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:30.779
- I don't follow many people.
- I'll consider it.

00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:33.324
I'd be nervous being mutuals
with a celebrity.

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:36.452
I'm not famous enough
for you to feel nervous.

00:41:36.952 --> 00:41:37.953
Well, who knows?

00:41:38.037 --> 00:41:41.790
You could blow up, just like you said,
and hit ten million followers.

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.335
Then they'd come
snooping around my account.

00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:50.716
You have a knack for saying no
in the most flattering way possible.

00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:54.887
We should head back down.

00:41:56.388 --> 00:42:00.476
The view from that observatory is great,
but we'd be late for dinner.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.395
Have you been here before?

00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:04.939
Yes.

00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:06.815
And you're here again?

00:42:07.441 --> 00:42:08.275
By yourself?

00:42:09.735 --> 00:42:11.487
There's a legend on this island.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.574
The legend says the dragon god of the sea
fell for a maiden from the heavens

00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:17.952
and made this island as a gift for her.

00:42:19.828 --> 00:42:21.455
I guess he really went all out.

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.707
The person I came here with

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:26.126
said they wanted this island
for their birthday too.

00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:29.838
Today happens to be their birthday,
so I thought I'd stop by.

00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:34.927
An island as a birthday gift?

00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:38.305
They wanted you here on their birthday?

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.224
That's a confession. Was it a woman?

00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:47.523
Come on. You witnessed
every detail of my pathetic love life.

00:42:48.023 --> 00:42:49.191
It's only fair you spill.

00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:51.610
Why would I share any of that
with a stranger?

00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:53.487
That's exactly why you would!

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.906
You can speak freely,
since we'll never see each other again.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.742
That's why I'm not embarrassed at all.

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.583
It was a very long time ago.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.793
And back then,

00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:11.797
I pretended not to understand her,
the same way you did earlier.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.305
She confessed in a roundabout way
and probably thought you rejected her.

00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:25.436
Why not ask her to join you here now?
You said today is her birthday.

00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:29.106
She has someone else
to spend birthdays with now.

00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:37.990
Come on. We'll be late.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.039
Wait for me.

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.810
I think we're almost there.

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:08.896
Can't we just ask a passerby
for directions?

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.606
You even speak Japanese.

00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:12.566
No.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:16.570
I think I know where it is now.

00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:20.157
It's just two more blocks this way.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.241
But

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.410
we keep going in circles.

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.289
- I think it's this way.
- Hey, stop. Wait there.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.382
I think the restaurant's this way,
not that way.

00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:39.426
- It's this way.
- Wanna bet?

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.970
If I win, you have to follow me.

00:44:42.054 --> 00:44:44.139
Is getting 10,000 followers
that important?

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:46.767
It is to me. So you agree to the bet?

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:56.443
Excuse me.

00:44:57.611 --> 00:44:58.862
Restaurant.

00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:00.447
- Hey, Jin-suk.
- That way?

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:01.782
- I'm in Japan.
- This way?

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:04.451
Hey. It's Ji-sun's birthday today,

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:06.995
but we had a fight,
and now I can't reach her.

00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:10.290
I just saw her post on Instagram.
Looks like she's in Japan.

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:13.293
Can you check
and see if you can tell where exactly?

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:19.967
- It's that way.
- This way?

00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:22.386
Thank… Thank you.

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:27.266
Hey! The restaurant is this way.

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:28.559
Yes! I win.

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.150
What's the matter?

00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:38.861
The person whose birthday is today

00:45:39.611 --> 00:45:40.821
is there on that island.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.699
That's great!

00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:46.869
Go! Hurry up and go to her! I'll be fine.

00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:51.415
This is an opportunity.

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:54.877
If you waste it,
you'll end up here again, all alone.

00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:59.339
No playing dumb this time.

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:01.842
Then things will change.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:37.711
He went.

00:46:42.716 --> 00:46:44.802
It's a shame I don't even have his number.

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.271
I wonder if he'll follow me.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.962
This is an announcement
for visitors to Enoshima Observatory.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.406
NA JIN-SUK

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:38.749
Who is it?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.254
Room service.

00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:58.810
Have a pleasant evening.

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:22.626
Cut, okay!

00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:24.086
We're good!

00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:31.176
Pretty good, right?

00:49:31.259 --> 00:49:32.928
The scenes are much gorier

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.223
than how they were written in the script.

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:41.812
But the background music will be very…
How should I describe it?

00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:44.731
Really bright and upbeat.
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:46.566
Right, sure!

00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:51.863
Today's the last day of filming,

00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:54.574
and our film will be a hit.

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.202
Our lead character, Do Ra-mi!

00:49:57.703 --> 00:49:59.454
- You got this!
- I got this!

00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.874
I should get back.
That rib cage is so cute.

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:07.754
Mu-hee.

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.506
Today's our last day,

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:11.758
but I still don't get
what this movie is about.

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.344
Is this a horror movie or a comedy?

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:20.726
Our director is a genius.
Don't you dare try to judge his art.

00:50:21.226 --> 00:50:24.021
I'm just worried
since it's your first lead role.

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.772
Even your name's weird.

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.983
"Do Ra-mi"?
"Do Re-mi" would make more sense.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.154
If this were an obvious hit,

00:50:32.237 --> 00:50:34.573
the role of Do Ra-mi
wouldn't have come to me.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.201
I'll just give it my all
until the very end.

00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:42.080
- Today might not be our last day.
- We ask for your understanding.

00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:45.625
The director argued with the stunt team,
so it might be called off.

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:48.086
We'll move quickly
so we can shoot everything, okay?

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.380
That makes no sense!
We're the ones setting up.

00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:51.715
They're at it again.

00:50:51.798 --> 00:50:54.593
- Please calm down a bit and--
- You're telling me to calm down?

00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:58.055
Faster isn't necessarily better.
I'm just asking for more time to prepare.

00:50:58.138 --> 00:51:00.265
I told you before.
We can't do all this today!

00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.157
I, well…

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:21.703
Thanks for doing the stunt yourself.
It's a tough scene.

00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:24.790
Of course I should do it.
This is the most important scene.

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.918
And it's the last day of filming.

00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:30.837
I swear we'll do this in one take,
just like we promised.

00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:32.172
Good.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.424
Be careful.

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.260
Just relax.

00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:42.933
The fireworks festival starts at 9:00.

00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:46.645
Let's all pick up the pace
so we can wrap this up before then.

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:52.275
Yes.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.069
Okay, ready?

00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:55.612
Here we go.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.496
HOTEL DIAMORTE

00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:17.008
HOTEL DI E

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:21.805
Cut, okay!

00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:22.931
We're good!

00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:24.766
That's a wrap!

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:26.643
Great work, everyone!

00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:28.645
Hey, reel in the stunt wire!

00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.231
- Great job. Thank you.
- Thanks for all your work.

00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:41.116
Mu-hee!

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:21.364
As I shut my eyes for what I thought
would be my last moments,

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.158
elsewhere,

00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:26.328
they were busy
enjoying a festival of their own.

00:53:27.412 --> 00:53:30.207
My life had been
entirely devoid of fireworks,

00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:35.045
and here they were,
exploding in the distant sky.

00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:37.672
How beautiful.

00:53:44.763 --> 00:53:45.847
It pisses me off.

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:12.958
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.253
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:54:38.483 --> 00:54:40.610
You're finally awake, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.028
Congratulations.

00:54:57.335 --> 00:54:59.713
Ms. Cha Mu-hee has regained consciousness.

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:03.717
The whole world rooted for Do Ra-mi,
and now she's back with us.

00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:09.139
To our relief, she immediately recognized
everyone around her

00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:11.099
and has no problems communicating.

00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:15.145
The Korean actress Cha Mu-hee,
who sparked the Do Ra-mi craze worldwide,

00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:17.647
{\an8}has finally regained consciousness.

00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:21.860
{\an8}Last July, Ms. Cha fell from a rooftop
while filming The Quiet Woman.

00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:27.824
…came out of a coma after six months.

00:55:27.907 --> 00:55:29.909
The actress suffered a serious accident

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.288
when she fell from a roof
while filming the movie The Quiet Woman.

00:55:56.853 --> 00:56:00.857
The Korean actress Cha Mu-hee,
who sparked the Do Ra-mi craze worldwide,

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.276
has finally regained consciousness.

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:11.409
I had simply closed my eyes
for a brief moment,

00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:15.413
but in the world laid before me
when I reopened them,

00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:18.249
for the first time in my life,

00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:22.087
a lavish festival
was being held just for me.

00:56:22.837 --> 00:56:25.006
Ms. Cha, who's made a miraculous recovery,

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:28.093
is said to be experiencing
no cognitive issues

00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:31.137
and, barring any lingering aftereffects,
should be able to resume…

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:33.431
You're finally awake, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:37.519
Fans around the world are hoping
Ms. Cha's condition improves

00:56:37.602 --> 00:56:40.605
and that she makes a return
to the big screen soon…

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.001
And my festival

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:05.588
ended up shaking his life to the core.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.891
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?
