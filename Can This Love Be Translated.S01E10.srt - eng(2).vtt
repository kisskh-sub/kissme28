00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.351
Do Ra-mi?

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.875
Your delusions

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.462
are sad because they're too beautiful.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:18.304
Were you crying?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:24.644
I finally said the goodbye
you couldn't bring yourself to say.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.692
Now please be happy.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.836
Goodbye.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:29.709
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.890
What did she mean by saying goodbye?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.602
Does she mean she won't show up anymore?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.689
Babe. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.155
I don't have any Italian money.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.787
Where's that man
who's fluent in Italian? "Babe"?

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.122
"Babe"?

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.041
You know Korean?

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:14.379
We even took a picture together
with "babe."

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:16.631
I'm sorry.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.177
I don't get what you're saying.
I can't understand you.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.764
That hat.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.269
Did she buy it from you?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.271
Maria, I'm going.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.856
I need to get going. See you later.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:38.778
She did.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.738
It's the hat Do Ra-mi bought.

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.076
There aren't any other photos.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.577
Did she delete them?

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:53.876
Here it is.

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.838
This is her "babe."

00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:59.173
That's too bad.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.053
Should I find out
what Do Ra-mi has been up to?

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.891
No, nothing bad has happened.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.853
And the shoot's almost over.
Let's not worry about it.

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:19.110
I was wondering
why he wasn't staying with us,

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:21.404
but it must be because of his girlfriend.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:24.449
They must have been
out on dates every night.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:28.578
It could just be a girl who's a friend,
not a girlfriend.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.079
But he had her in his arms.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:34.042
He speaks fluent Italian,
so maybe she's Italian.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.795
He said he lived here when he was young,
so maybe someone he knew then?

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.713
A first love?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.090
For God's sake, cut it out already.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.136
Whether Mr. Joo meets his girlfriend
every night or is staying at her place

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.513
is his business,
so let's keep our noses out of it.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.515
Yes, sir.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.562
Sorry I ever said anything. Man.

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:56.773
I'm just saying
that it's his private life.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:04.155
There will be a wedding tomorrow
at the winery where we're shooting today.

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:07.950
The festival is canceled due to the fire,
so we'll be attending the wedding instead.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:09.994
Sure.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.500
Does it still bother you
how Ms. Cha Mu-hee left yesterday?

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.797
No. I just saw
something strange yesterday.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.342
What did you see?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.095
Do Ra-mi?

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:29.597
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is Do Ra-mi.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.102
Yes, Cha Mu-hee is Do Ra-mi,
but I saw the real Do Ra-mi, not a zombie.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:38.022
Don't you often refer to Ms. Cha Mu-hee
as "zombie" or "Do Ra-mi"?

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.526
I don't call her that because I hate her.
I mean, I did at first.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.654
But it just stuck,
and she doesn't seem to hate it either.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.656
No woman would think

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.201
a guy who calls her a zombie
is actually interested.

00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:51.911
What are you, a choding?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.621
Choding?

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:55.581
I've heard that word before.

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.042
It means something bad, doesn't it?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.669
It means "cute."

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.298
Before I forget,
here are the opera tickets you asked for.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.926
You can give them to her
during the winery shoot.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.053
Why would I do that?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.806
That way, she won't refuse them.

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:14.725
You never ask someone out
if rejection's on the table.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.894
This has nothing to do with the shoot.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.731
Besides, I haven't decided if I'll go.

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.069
Hiro.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.991
Can I tell you what happened
the other day during dinner

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:32.034
with the crew?

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:40.835
Joo Ho-jin was with a woman?

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:49.385
Mr. Joo Ho-jin would never do
something like that.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.056
Then again, why not?

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.144
But I didn't think he'd ever do that.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.441
Well, what can I do about it?

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.240
Hurts.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.620
Well, I'm okay.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:21.876
PAPAGO♥

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.336
Joo Ho-jin?

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:25.630
You read Korean?

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:29.467
If you're thinking of asking him
whether he has a girlfriend, don't.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:31.969
You'd regret it.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.222
Hey, give that back.

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:35.681
Hey, give…

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.312
Slick moves, zombie.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.232
Yes, I'm a zombie. I'm Do Ra-mi!

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.778
I forgot not to call her a zombie!

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.662
The new location is my mother's winery?

00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.914
Didn't Jin-suk call you?

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:02.208
He said he told you.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:04.377
He did call.

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:07.213
Out of nowhere,
he asked how she was doing,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.549
then said it was about time I met her.

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.927
That must have been him telling me.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:16.556
Will you be okay with meeting her?

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.808
I have to be. This is work.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.395
But don't tell the crew.
Things could get awkward.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:23.646
Of course.

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.147
Anyway,

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.608
I'm so sorry.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:28.943
No, it's okay.

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:32.363
You must've been desperate
if you were willing to call Jin-suk.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:36.617
Calling my ex-fiancé to help me scout
a location for a shoot

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.494
made me feel like dying.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.162
No need to go that far.

00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:43.082
Jin-suk's not one to care
about things like that.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:47.336
It's been a while since Joo Ho-jin
comforted me for something Na Jin-suk did.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:48.921
Is that right?

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:50.840
It's my turn now.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.595
Tell me when it's time.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:57.805
Tell you what?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.975
In the blink of an eye,

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.019
it seems I've earned myself

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.688
an Italian girlfriend
who I go out with every night.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:07.648
Babe.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.742
Why are you so surprised?

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.954
How do you say "babe" in Italian?

00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.333
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.461
Why are you saying my name?

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.422
"Ms. Cha Mu-hee"
can't possibly be "babe" in Italian.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:37.178
Tell me. I bet you know all too well
what "babe" is in Italian.

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.555
I'm just curious.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.015
Well, don't.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.142
Why not?

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.062
Can't I ask what "babe" is in Italian
if I don't have a babe?

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.857
No, not that. Don't say "babe."
I don't want to hear it.

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.943
Babe… What's wrong with the word "babe"?

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.320
I just don't like it.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.696
Don't say it.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.490
Why don't you like it?

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.243
Isn't it warm and sweet
when someone calls you that?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.204
Sweet?

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.166
Is it?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.089
Then say it again.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:15.883
Me?

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:19.762
Babe.

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:23.808
One more time.

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:30.898
Babe.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.361
Do you hate it?

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.404
That's enough.

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.282
Going forward, Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
you're forbidden from saying "babe."

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:41.951
Don't confuse me.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:45.955
What? When would I ever call you "babe"?

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.708
Although I'm sure you hear it
from someone else.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.212
I guess you heard
what the crew saw that night.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.507
I did hear that you were with someone,

00:11:57.007 --> 00:12:00.010
and that someone was a woman.

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:05.307
With that kind heart of yours,

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:08.144
leave this girl

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.813
so that I can disappear.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.442
That's right. I was.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:19.447
And I suppose that woman
does call me "babe."

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.825
So it's true.

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:29.290
Who is she?

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.924
If you really want to hear the answer,

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.926
I can tell you.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.679
But prepare yourself.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.765
Your knowing would make us both suffer.

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:49.393
I could deal with it,

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.646
but would you be okay?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.029
No. I don't want to know.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.786
Congratulations on your new "babe."

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.206
Not that I'm your old "babe" or anything.

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:11.665
I'm not, no.

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:15.836
I was never your "babe" to begin with,
so I can congratulate you.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.631
Don't.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.343
You're saying that makes all of this…

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:25.930
feel so unfair.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.487
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:43.906
"Babe"? Why'd I call him "babe"?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.451
Congratulations? Unbelievable.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:22.653
Welcome to our winery.

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.864
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:30.744
Tell me if there's anything you need.
I'll do my best to be of help.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.206
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:37.877
These are our cast members,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee and Mr. Hiro Kurosawa.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.295
Nice to meet you, Ms. Cha.

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.546
Nice to meet you.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.007
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.468
I hope you enjoy it here.

00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:48.846
Thank you.

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:52.308
This is Dario. He runs the winery with me.

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.018
Good morning. Welcome.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:55.561
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:56.604
Hello.

00:14:57.938 --> 00:14:58.939
- Dario.
- Yes?

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:02.484
We should first show them
around the winery.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.777
Of course.

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.195
Thank you so much.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:10.534
I thought she was just the wife
of a wealthy winery owner.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.745
How many languages does she speak?

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.748
Yeah, she's a lot like
someone else we know.

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.041
Who?

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:27.593
Ho-jin has a lot to prepare for the shoot,
so he's probably in the van.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:29.345
I see.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.434
I've been so nervous. This isn't easy.

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.605
What should I prepare for the shoot first?

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.531
Her hair's gotten grayer.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.378
Be careful.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.380
This is amazing.

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.756
I guess this is it.

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.011
Wow, it's huge.

00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:15.432
Which one?

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:16.809
This one?

00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:18.686
This one?

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:31.782
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:39.581
Look, it's working!

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.836
It's heavy.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:50.968
CHA MU-HEE

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.598
You really do know how to write my name.

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:00.728
Here.

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:02.813
For you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:15.200
And then horizontally…

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.493
Then down…

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.746
Right. Then vertically…

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.542
Like this.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.461
- Dot, dot, dot.
- Dot, dot, dot.

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:27.421
- "Kuro."
- Yes.

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:28.338
"Kuro."

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.679
Hiro is behaving differently again.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.807
He's being really sweet now.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.893
Maybe he'll keep his promise at this rate.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:42.644
You mean confess?

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.482
I doubt it. People only confess
when they know the feelings are mutual.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.566
What do you mean?

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.194
Mu-hee looks happy too.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.834
Isn't he an author?

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.504
He's Mr. Kim Young-hwan, isn't he?

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:09.963
Yes.

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:13.717
My father ran a publishing house.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.763
Mr. Kim Young-hwan was someone
he was especially close to. Like family.

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:20.390
Did your father

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.644
collect a lot of antiques
when he was alive?

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.647
Yes, that's right. How did you know that?

00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:29.608
Are you Mr. Joo Ho-jin's mother?

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.655
Yes, I am.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:39.618
Hello.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:40.536
Yes, hello.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.246
I had no idea.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.998
Though I guess I see the resemblance.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:49.044
This is Mr. Joo's mother.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.338
Mother.

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.132
Ho-jin's mother?

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:56.176
- No wonder.
- She's really his mother?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.719
They look nothing alike.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.930
Yes, she's my mother.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.016
- He must take after his dad.
- I guess so.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.477
- Would you like to say hi?
- Sorry?

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.941
Well,

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:14.528
your son is watching us
through that camera there.

00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:16.822
One second.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.074
Here.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.579
You can look into that camera
and say hello.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.250
Ho-jin, it's Mom. Can you see me?

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.340
Yes, I see you,

00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:37.259
Mother.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.344
How have you been?

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.391
That was his mother?

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.643
How come they didn't even say hi?

00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.353
Tell me about it.

00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:51.148
I thought we wouldn't get
to see them talking,

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:52.608
but Mu-hee made it look easy.

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:56.653
I heard you were coming, so I made dinner.
Would you care to join?

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.329
Yes, okay.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:07.998
Okay.

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.709
Let's talk more later.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.895
I didn't know you were on awkward terms
with your mother. I'm sorry.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.650
Thanks to you, we greeted each other
in the most ridiculous way possible.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:39.655
Given what's happened,
your mother would be really disappointed

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.782
if you left without sharing a meal.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:44.534
Why not enjoy
a delicious home-cooked meal?

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.995
My mother can't cook,
so the meal won't be delicious.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.749
And brace yourself,
since it's going to be very awkward.

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:52.542
Why should I?

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.422
After what you did,
you'd make me go alone?

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.050
You got me into this, so come with me.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:03.470
But what would I even do there?

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:07.140
Do what you do best.
Blurt out things when it gets awkward.

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.476
I need someone just like that.

00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.898
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, is it that hard for you
to meet your mother?

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.694
It's been 13 years

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.613
since I last spoke to her.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.826
We had a major fight, never made up,

00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:29.705
and let too much time pass,
ignoring one another.

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:35.544
Then… you probably wouldn't even know
what to say to her.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:38.630
Don't worry.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.426
I'll try to break the ice
by bringing up wine or something.

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.303
Do you know a lot about wine?

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.723
Not really.
I'll just say whatever comes to mind.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.892
"How much does a bottle cost?
Is business good?" That sort of thing.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:54.021
So you're really thinking of saying
whatever comes to mind.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.442
Come to think of it,
I'd be interpreting for you this time.

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:03.405
You're both fluent in several languages,
so how come you can't just talk?

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:08.160
As an interpreter who specializes
in small talk, I've got your back.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.496
Okay. I'm counting on you, Ms. Cha.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.612
Your mother seemed really young.

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.366
As a freshman, she met my father,
a visiting professor,

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:48.825
and got married right away.

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:52.537
He'd already been married twice
and had a son at that point.

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.541
So they had a passionate love affair.

00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.461
And what about your father?

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:03.715
He's now retired,
happily jogging Florida's beaches.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:06.593
He's determined to travel to space
before he dies,

00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:09.471
so his sole focus is getting into shape.

00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:12.349
A winery and space travel?

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:15.769
I guess you don't take after your parents.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:18.980
I take after my maternal grandfather.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.275
Right, the antique collector.

00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:24.236
I could see that.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.366
He's the groom in tomorrow's wedding.

00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:33.203
You weren't there when we said hello.

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:36.998
He helps your mother run the winery
and is getting married tomorrow.

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.626
I did hear
there was going to be a wedding.

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:43.296
How's dinner coming along?

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:47.342
What's wrong?

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.387
I guess I'm nervous. I got a little hurt.

00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:54.433
Don't worry. It's nothing.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:57.936
You should be more careful.
Your hands are precious.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.148
I told you it's fine.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.774
Please, let me see it.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.317
- No.
- It looks serious.

00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.111
- Please let me see it.
- No.

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.195
Come on, let me--

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.196
Let go of her!

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:14.286
- Are you okay?
- Ho-jin.

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.872
- What's your problem?
- Who are you?

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.584
Let go of me--

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:23.795
Are you all right?

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.213
Yes.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.798
I'm all right.

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:29.593
Get away from her!

00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:38.685
Ho-jin!

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:40.061
Stop, Dario!

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:41.062
My goodness!

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.940
Stop! Stop it!

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.569
Stop it.

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.196
Good heavens.

00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:53.825
That's enough. Stop!

00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:55.327
Ho-jin!

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:05.170
Stop it. He's my son!

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:12.552
- He's your son?
- Yes, he's my son.

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:22.270
You calm down too, Ho-jin. I'll explain.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:25.899
But that bastard kept grabbing you
when you said no.

00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:27.359
It's not like that.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:31.238
It's not? Then who is he?

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.991
- We're getting married.
- Yeah, he's getting…

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.536
Sorry?

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:41.289
This is Dario.
We're getting married tomorrow.

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:48.129
I meant to introduce him to you at dinner,
but I guess it's too late now.

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:54.469
So…

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:56.888
Hold up.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:00.225
The wedding taking place here tomorrow

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.310
is yours?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.272
I told Jin-suk. Didn't he tell you?

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:07.899
No, he didn't.
He just said I should meet you.

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:13.738
Then this must have been a surprise.
I thought you came here knowing.

00:26:16.157 --> 00:26:19.286
So if I hadn't come here for work,

00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:21.413
I never would've known?

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.124
Unbelievable.

00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:26.084
And how…

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:27.419
Him.

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:29.754
How old is this kid?

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.424
He's not a kid.
He's eight years older than you.

00:26:32.507 --> 00:26:34.050
I might as well call him "friend."

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:37.929
Not really. Mr. Kim is eight years older
than me, but I call him mister.

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:41.391
That's because you met him
when you were really young.

00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:42.559
That's different.

00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:45.645
What's so different?
We're also eight years apart.

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:48.231
Always sure you're right.
You haven't changed.

00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:51.109
You haven't changed a bit either.
You only ever criticize me.

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.283
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee.
- Oh no!

00:27:01.661 --> 00:27:03.997
Here?

00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:08.251
Are you okay? Shouldn't you see a doctor?

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:11.796
It's okay.
I'll just have a bump on my head.

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.092
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
gotten you involved in this mess.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:17.761
Not at all.

00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:20.263
This only happened because I meddled.

00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:23.558
Were you bleeding?

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.645
Were you hurt anywhere else?

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.356
I'm fine. Dario looks a lot worse.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:31.733
Was he bleeding too?

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:33.943
He didn't bleed,

00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:35.987
but there's a bruise…

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.741
- And the wedding's tomorrow.
- Right.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.911
Your mother's eyes flashed

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.413
when she thought her son might be hurt.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.126
So instead of arguing,
try talking to her again.

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:55.840
And did you fall on purpose
to make us stop arguing?

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:57.884
Was it that obvious?

00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:02.764
Well, things were getting heated,

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.100
and I couldn't exactly
get in the middle of it.

00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.395
So I just tried whatever.

00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:10.563
You should have just faked it.

00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:13.358
What if you'd been seriously hurt?

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.568
I'm Do Ra-mi.

00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:17.654
I'm great at action scenes. Don't worry.

00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:25.120
Thank you.

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.291
I actually was saying
whatever came to mind

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:34.212
and almost went too far,
past the point of no return,

00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:36.798
but we stopped thanks to you.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.677
In that case,
the back of my head saved the day.

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:49.978
Does this side hurt? Here?

00:28:50.937 --> 00:28:52.105
A little.

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.108
Then stay like this for a little bit.

00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:23.261
You know,

00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:26.222
Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:36.399
About your "babe…"

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.494
Ho-jin.

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:51.748
Your mother's waiting for you.

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:56.711
I should go talk to her.

00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:58.338
Go get some rest.

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.230
Does Father know?
About you getting married?

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.773
He does.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.027
He wanted to attend,
but I talked him out of it.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.781
As a wedding gift,

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.116
he sent me several cases of wine.

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.620
Gifting cases of wine to a winery?

00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:34.582
Your father's still
as unruly and inconsiderate as ever.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.168
And you ended up regretting
ever marrying him.

00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:41.005
Do you really… want to enter
another reckless marriage?

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:42.423
Why?

00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:45.927
Are you going to write a novel
about my second marriage too?

00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:53.434
Mr. Kim told me

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:56.479
that you stopped writing because of me.

00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:58.731
Is that true?

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:02.443
That's not your concern.
You burned my book in front of me.

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.361
That was…

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:07.907
I was just mad that you only criticized me
in that novel of yours.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.538
Still, you didn't have to pull
a bestseller out of print right away.

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:17.041
I did that
because you left after declaring

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.168
that you'd never speak to me again.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.800
It was the only way for me to apologize

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:28.177
without saying the words.

00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:46.195
I took my anger
over my failed marriage out

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:47.989
on your novel.

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:51.784
After my anger subsided,

00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:54.370
I wanted to apologize to you,

00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.832
but I didn't know how to bring it up.

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:11.095
The wine here… Is business good?

00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:16.517
Yeah, it's not too bad.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.394
Dario's got a knack for wine.

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:19.854
- Right, Dario.
- Yeah.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.398
He's no fighter,
but I'm glad he does his job well.

00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.153
Are you okay?

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.364
Will you be okay?

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.658
Dario… will have a bruise.

00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:34.035
How could I just watch my son
get beaten up?

00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:38.456
Didn't I sign you up for tae kwon do,
kendo, and judo classes as a kid?

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:40.792
How could you not land a single punch?

00:32:41.918 --> 00:32:42.877
Right?

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.514
I'm sorry.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.612
I won't be able to cook dinner in there.

00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:16.869
I'm sorry too.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:58.661
From the wedding to the reception,
the shoot was a total success!

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:00.163
Great work.

00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:02.832
It's all thanks to Mr. Na Jin-suk.

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:04.959
Eat up.

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:09.505
Mr. Na really is kind of careless,
isn't he?

00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:13.009
He didn't even tell us
the bride was Mr. Joo's mother.

00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:14.927
What if we'd offended her somehow?

00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:16.471
That's just how he is.

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:21.184
Ji-sun, will your wedding happen
once the shoot's over?

00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:24.687
That's the plan.

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:28.775
Why don't we all pitch in to get Ji-sun

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.860
one massive wedding gift?

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:32.570
- Sure!
- What should we get her?

00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:35.490
- I vote for a robot vacuum.
- How about a steam closet?

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:36.783
That's a great idea.

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:39.368
- And a card.
- Two smaller gifts or one big one?

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:42.663
One big one?

00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.624
For your wedding gifts,

00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:47.752
how about we get you
a steam closet and a robot vacuum?

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.965
Sorry, I don't think that'll work.

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.634
Is that right?

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:58.137
Then… Right, how about a TV?

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.306
It's not that.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.185
The wedding's off.

00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:09.273
We broke off the engagement
before I joined the Canada shoot.

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.609
I didn't tell you
in case you'd feel awkward,

00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:14.070
but I'm telling you
since tomorrow's our last day.

00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.365
Oh dear, I had no clue.

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:18.616
I even made you call him.

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:21.202
It's okay. I'm the one who kept quiet.

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.662
Don't worry about it.

00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:25.331
Excuse me.

00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:30.711
What's there to be awkward about?

00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:33.422
- She should've told us.
- Yeah.

00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:36.551
She should've just said
when I asked about the ring.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.427
You noticed?

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:40.555
Oh, come on.

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.223
Why didn't you tell me?

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:45.101
Think this is the only thing
I've been keeping from you?

00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:47.478
Wait, there's more? What else do you know?

00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:50.606
Forget it, okay?
Let's respect people's privacy.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.774
Cheers.

00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.820
I just told everyone
that the wedding's off.

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.284
I hadn't told them yet

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:05.037
because I was afraid
I wasn't completely over him.

00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:08.374
But talking to him on the phone,

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:11.586
I realized I don't miss him anymore.

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:16.465
I was worried that call
might bring you two back together.

00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:28.561
We started with uneven scores.

00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:34.317
With a single shot, you hit the bullseye
and won all the points,

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.778
while I might still be sitting at zero.

00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:46.037
I wouldn't say
you haven't scored a single point.

00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:49.624
Maybe

00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:51.709
three points?

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.837
I'd say you've scored about that much.

00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:59.008
I hit a three-pointer in my first match
and cried all night.

00:36:59.508 --> 00:37:00.843
I'll be crying tonight too.

00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:03.221
Happy tears.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:10.728
Guess how long it took me
to jump from a three to a four.

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:14.607
I don't know. A month?

00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:15.942
Three months?

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:18.027
Ten seconds.

00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:23.532
What's my score now?

00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:26.577
Fine. Four points.

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:31.958
Should I raise it to five while I'm at it?
That would take more time though.

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:33.501
I'd need more than ten seconds.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.587
Never mind. You're back down to zero.

00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:39.799
Come on, that's not fair.
You can't take back points.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:46.973
Five points.

00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:51.060
I don't hand out points
that easily, you know.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.105
Four and a half, then.

00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:37.940
She ran away.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:42.486
The childhood memories
she must never recall

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.572
and the times she spent with you,

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:46.866
they'll all disappear with me.

00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:50.911
So let her go.

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.497
Let Cha Mu-hee be happy.

00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:32.745
Don't go.

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.206
Party.

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.665
Here.

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:40.044
Hey, your Korean is getting better
by the day.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.631
Hang on.

00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.800
I've prepared something too.

00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:53.849
Ta-da!

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.816
My farewell message for our last shoot.
My parting words.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.234
Parting…

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:10.408
"Our journey together has been wonderful."

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.578
"Although our journey ends here,

00:40:15.287 --> 00:40:19.583
I will always root for you
as your friend."

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.090
How was that?

00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:31.429
Didn't you get it?

00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:36.684
An unremarkable goodbye
that could have been for anyone.

00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:42.731
At this rate, all this will end
with an utterly forgettable goodbye.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:48.195
You seem to be saying
you didn't really like it.

00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.868
I'll practice it some more.

00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:06.630
Ms. Cha Mu-hee seems to have prepared
a message in Japanese.

00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:11.302
I don't like unremarkable things.

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.472
I'd have preferred something shocking.

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.224
At least then
it would have been memorable.

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:42.875
There you are.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:44.627
Hey.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.634
This is too heavy and dry.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.802
Young ladies prefer

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:57.389
something a little lighter
and more refreshing.

00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:01.018
This would be better.

00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:04.563
Isn't it your last night in Italy?

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:08.275
Share it with…
that actress friend of yours.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:11.820
Mr. Kim is quite the gossip, isn't he?

00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:14.823
I think

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.117
this would be better.

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.246
For a dry and heavy drink alone.

00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:23.958
Is it one-sided?

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:27.836
Is that it?

00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:32.675
I suppose. She says she can't have
a happy ending with me.

00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:37.096
It didn't even cross my mind.

00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:40.266
How could she not like you?

00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:41.600
Sorry?

00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:44.228
Even as a little kid,
when I sent you to tae kwon do,

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:45.938
all the girls would look at you,

00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:48.148
not the black-belt boy
doing a double side kick.

00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:49.733
Not to mention school.

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:52.736
Remember all the chocolates you'd get
every Valentine's Day?

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.573
Come on, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.408
Well, it hurts my pride.

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.661
Will wine be enough?
There's some whiskey in there.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.458
I'm not in so much pain
that I need something that strong.

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.460
I was just

00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:11.213
calmly finding closure.

00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:14.425
All right.

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:18.095
If a bottle of wine is enough
to comfort you,

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.014
I won't worry too much.

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.892
Don't. And give this to me.

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:25.811
Go on. They'll be waiting.

00:43:35.487 --> 00:43:36.530
Ho-jin.

00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:39.366
You once

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.077
came home from tae kwon do

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:44.538
with a broken arm

00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:48.876
and calmly said that all you needed
was some banana milk.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.462
It must have hurt a lot.

00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:58.469
I'm just saying
that's how you've always been.

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.918
This is Mr. Joo Ho-jin's phone.

00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:42.930
It's in Italian.

00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.140
Is it from that woman?

00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:50.688
What does it mean?

00:45:35.274 --> 00:45:36.442
It's you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:44.616
You got a text.

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:52.416
I couldn't read it anyway,
since I don't know Italian.

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:53.751
I know.

00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:59.757
Aren't you going to reply?

00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:01.925
What if it's something urgent?

00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.595
It isn't. Do you want to see?

00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:07.139
I wouldn't understand.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:10.225
It's from my friend
who owns the Italian restaurant.

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:11.560
We went together, remember?

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:12.978
Right.

00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:15.647
That restaurant with the delicious pasta?

00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:18.650
I see.

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:22.613
What are you doing here?
You should go have fun with everyone.

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.954
I came to say goodbye.

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:34.625
Tomorrow's our last day.

00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:38.629
We are on different flights,
so I figured now's our chance.

00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:48.806
Thank you for everything.

00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.724
It all went smoothly thanks to you.

00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:57.606
Sure.

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:00.234
I'm glad it ended well.

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.696
I'm going to call it a night.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.208
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.386
I'm sorry I threatened you.

00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:32.432
I started something
I couldn't even handle.

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.687
I'm truly sorry about everything.

00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:41.692
Still,

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.363
thank you for not hating me too much.

00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:53.453
Hearing your voice,
it felt like we were traveling together…

00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:59.710
and knowing this is the end, I feel a bit…

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.714
sad.

00:48:12.306 --> 00:48:14.474
Stay here. I'll go.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.746
I barely managed to calm my heart…

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.458
so why shake me up again?

00:48:44.546 --> 00:48:46.506
You feel sorry, grateful, and sad,

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.342
but this is the end?

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.723
Then, since this is the end,

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:58.018
shall I let you sweep me away?

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:01.939
It's not like that.

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.817
Why would I do that
when you're seeing somebody else?

00:49:05.901 --> 00:49:07.653
Seeing somebody else?

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:15.869
Right.

00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:20.666
That woman told me not to see you again.

00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:25.379
So cut it out and go.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.148
So…

00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:50.028
does that woman

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:51.530
know about me?

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.034
Yes.

00:49:56.868 --> 00:49:58.286
She knows you very well.

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.293
If there's been a misunderstanding,

00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:07.921
I'd feel bad about her too.

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.048
There's no need.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:11.466
Instead,

00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:13.719
be happy.

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:21.435
Since this is the end.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.031
The thought
that no one could ever love you

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:36.533
is only a delusion.

00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:40.746
And

00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:43.957
that delusion will disappear.

00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:54.509
I truly hope

00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:57.095
that you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee,

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.598
are happy.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.737
"Beautiful."

00:51:55.821 --> 00:51:57.572
"So much that I can't look away."

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.324
I agree.

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.454
We saw so many beautiful places
while filming.

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:09.209
I'm a little… bummed

00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:11.753
that it's over.

00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:15.298
I agree.

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:19.928
I would like…

00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:24.975
to keep seeing you.

00:52:30.897 --> 00:52:33.108
I think the reason every moment

00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:36.403
of our journey has been beautiful…

00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:41.074
is that you

00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:44.202
were a part of the scenery.

00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:50.542
What did he just say?

00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:52.460
Can you interpret…

00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:54.588
Is he saying goodbye?

00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:57.340
Should I give my farewell message now?

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:00.886
Mr. Joo,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.389
if you were too shocked
to interpret what I just said,

00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:06.892
can you just pass on

00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:08.602
these words to her?

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:14.399
I…

00:53:17.068 --> 00:53:19.487
really like you, Cha Mu-hee.

00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.624
Mr. Joo, what's he saying?

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.878
I can't reply
unless you pass on his message.

00:53:39.257 --> 00:53:41.593
I guess your farewell message
won't be necessary.

00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.304
Let me interpret his words.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.306
He asked me to tell you…

00:53:52.312 --> 00:53:53.230
"I

00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:56.066
really like you, Cha Mu-hee."

00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:10.956
Did you hear that?

00:54:11.873 --> 00:54:13.583
Did the message get through?

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.758
Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
would you like to take a quick break?

00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:27.681
What should I do?

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:34.479
What should I say to him, Mr. Joo?

00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:39.150
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:41.861
Whatever you may have to say,

00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:44.572
I'll interpret it for you.

00:54:45.323 --> 00:54:46.408
Go ahead and say it.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.798
No, there's no need
for you to pass this on.

00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:03.633
I'll do it myself.

00:55:21.943 --> 00:55:22.819
Thank you.

00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:30.410
Okay, that concludes our filming
of Romantic Trip.

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:32.120
Good work, everyone.

00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:33.621
Good work.

00:55:34.122 --> 00:55:36.041
Great work, everyone!

00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:43.840
It's really over.

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.639
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Great work.

00:55:51.723 --> 00:55:55.101
- Awesome work, guys.
- That was great.

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.394
Mr. Joo.

00:55:56.978 --> 00:55:58.355
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.733
Thanks for everything.

00:56:02.442 --> 00:56:04.319
- Eun-jin, check on the cast.
- I'll go now.

00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:05.987
I'll just grab some equipment.

00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:07.989
- Good work, Director.
- Great work.

00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:09.491
Thanks for your hard work.

00:56:13.328 --> 00:56:14.371
Mr…

00:56:29.636 --> 00:56:30.637
Hiro!

00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.475
You finally told Ms. Cha Mu-hee
how you feel.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.478
Is that what it looked like?

00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:40.438
It wasn't like that.

00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:42.482
Sorry?

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.234
She already rejected me a while ago.

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.028
Today…

00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.658
she was rejected.

00:56:55.286 --> 00:56:56.121
Mu-hee!

00:56:58.039 --> 00:57:00.542
Everyone's so happy.
They say the show will be a hit.

00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:02.085
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:57:14.556 --> 00:57:17.684
It ended just like your favorite movie.
With a happy ending.

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:20.603
That movie didn't have
a truly happy ending.

00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:24.566
The song at the end is a really sad one.
One that's for when lovers part.

00:57:25.191 --> 00:57:26.401
Really?

00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:29.446
In any case, everyone's happy.

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.560
Now please be happy.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.521
I truly hope

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.149
that you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee,

00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:08.860
are happy.

00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:14.908
Mr. Joo Ho-jin

00:58:15.533 --> 00:58:17.535
said the same thing as Do Ra-mi.

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.716
Except for the few
who need to start editing immediately,

00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:34.886
the crew is staying for a few days,
so you can use your rooms.

00:58:35.386 --> 00:58:38.139
Thank you,
but we're also flying back tomorrow.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.643
How about Mr. Joo?
I haven't seen him since we wrapped.

00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:43.728
He's flying back with us, isn't he?

00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:45.939
He'll meet us at the airport.

00:58:48.816 --> 00:58:53.738
Are Hiro and Mu-hee going
to the opera today?

00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:56.449
Does that mean they're a real couple now?

00:59:18.846 --> 00:59:21.432
These tickets must have been expensive.
Thank you.

00:59:21.933 --> 00:59:23.810
These seats in particular.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.521
Thank you. Arigato.

00:59:29.983 --> 00:59:30.817
Are you okay?

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.157
Have you also let go of everything
after being totally rejected?

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:42.996
You seem to be doing better
than I thought you would.

00:59:57.969 --> 00:59:59.596
A video?

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.561
One moment. Sorry.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:19.699
Why are you out here?

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.326
Why not join us inside and watch?

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.579
I don't really like operas.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.205
I like K-pop.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.291
Me too, to be honest.

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.209
I'm worried I might fall asleep.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.130
Those shoes.

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:38.384
- Sorry?
- Your shoes.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:40.678
What about them?

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.268
The woman who was with Mr. Joo Ho-jin

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.896
was wearing the exact same shoes.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:53.816
I mistook her for you, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.694
Sorry about that.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.155
It's all right.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:19.342
The same shoes?

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.729
PRODUCER PARK IN-SU

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.941
I'm sending you some footage
we caught after the shoot.

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:39.570
It didn't seem fair that he could see you
when you couldn't see him.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:43.092
He told me to be happy, so I'll be happy.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:45.303
That's it.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:49.265
Run away just like that,
and hide where no one can find you.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.100
So you can be happy.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.178
I'm here again.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:30.765
Because this is where
all your anxiety began.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:48.908
The safest way for an unlovable child
to become happy

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.703
is for her to abandon everything
she might ever love.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:56.791
So the skies can never be painted
with colorful auroras again.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.844
Your childhood memories
and memories of Do Ra-mi…

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:12.014
Shut them away in this room
you ran away from.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.311
All you need to do
is leave this room and be happy.

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.749
Can I really
leave it all behind like this?

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.329
Hi, babe. It's me again.

01:06:41.288 --> 01:06:44.709
Then let's start by getting you
a coffee with two sugars.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.098
In a short while, when that bell rings,

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.268
she'll become truly happy.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.396
The kindness you wanted.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.356
Just accept it.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:09.275
Well done.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.757
Babe.

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:43.953
Mr. Joo, I heard you changed your flight.
Thank you for your hard work.

01:08:44.036 --> 01:08:45.329
PRODUCER PARK IN-SU

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.164
MS. CHA MU-HEE
BABE

01:09:43.137 --> 01:09:44.513
Now that you're here,

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.808
her wish just might come true.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.443
MAY AURORAS LIGHT UP THE ENTIRE WORLD!

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:02.948
Cha Mu-hee.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.463
MS. CHA MU-HEE

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.485
See? I still remember it.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.114
Rote memorization is pretty effective.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:30.661
I think I should start learning
another language too.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.372
I bought some gelato earlier,

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.333
and I thought I got strawberry,
but it was watermelon.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.544
So I wanted to ask them to swap it,

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:41.505
but I didn't know how to say that,
so I just ate it.

01:11:41.588 --> 01:11:44.008
But the watermelon flavor
was pretty good too.

01:11:47.052 --> 01:11:48.304
I know.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.098
I'm just saying whatever comes to mind

01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:52.725
because I'm embarrassed.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.603
I remembered everything.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.316
Babe.

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:05.571
She said

01:12:06.363 --> 01:12:08.282
all those memories would disappear.

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.328
I couldn't let them disappear.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.456
Because

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.417
you were in those memories.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.508
Do Ra-mi told you, didn't she?

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:28.635
It's true.

01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:32.556
Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:36.185
I really like you.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:39.021
But…

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:44.610
you know everything about me…

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.947
and I hate that.

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:59.208
I was afraid the more my feelings grew,

01:13:00.834 --> 01:13:03.629
the harder the fall would be.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.134
So I thought I'd stopped myself.

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:13.639
But before I knew it,

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.934
I found myself liking you even more.

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:22.564
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.653
What should I do now?

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:36.412
You say you're afraid of falling,

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:38.664
yet you made this wish?

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.877
What, so we could die together?

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.755
No. Do you really think I'd want that?

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.215
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.094
If you see auroras everywhere you go,

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:54.054
you've lost it.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.059
I'm sorry.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.688
You'd snapped out of it
and were moving on,

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.273
but I ended up swaying you again.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:06.817
I just…

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:10.571
You accepted Do Ra-mi and all,

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.657
which made me grasp onto false hope.

01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:18.579
Go.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:24.960
You called me here only to push me away?
I won't let you do that to me again.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.841
All right. It must feel unfair.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.344
Then this time, you can reject me.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.055
I've done you so wrong.
I'll take the rejection.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:43.645
First, let's set this straight.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.524
I'm going to stop telling you

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:49.526
to be happy.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:55.949
We won't get a happy ending
because we're destined to break up.

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.122
An eternal love, a happy future…

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.790
I won't promise you those things.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.709
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.839
What are you saying right now?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.676
I'm saying there's no reason
to panic and run away

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:17.262
because we will break up.

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:23.852
I don't think I'm understanding you.

01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:30.025
Am I… Are you sure
you're rejecting me… right now?

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.237
I'm coming up with a plan

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:37.032
so that you don't reject me again
because you get all anxious.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.328
And your plan is for us to break up?

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:44.998
Are you crazy?

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.793
Fair enough.

01:15:50.837 --> 01:15:51.672
Still,

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.091
it seems your wish came true.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.136
Out of the two of us,

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:00.806
I tried to keep my sanity to the very end…

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:03.892
but I've gone mad.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:09.439
I keep seeing auroras.

01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:12.818
For quite some time now, actually.

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:21.660
This is me confessing.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.122
Don't you get it yet?

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:39.386
I think I do…

01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:45.100
but I'm not sure if I understood…

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:51.875
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:17.145
