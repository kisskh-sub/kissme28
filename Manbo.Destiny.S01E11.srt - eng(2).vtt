00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:37.862
Does it hurt?

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:39.515
This one.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:44.400
Hold it.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:58.708
Do you know what this is?

00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:01.592
Guan Mengmeng.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.092
Even if the king himself
showed up today, no one's saving you.

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:07.515
You little wench.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.720
Do you have any idea
how badly you ruined me?

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:10.631
Huh?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.554
Let's see how I deal with you.

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:13.092
Come on.

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:13.938
Take the hood off.

00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:15.669
Hurry up! Take her hood off.

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:22.131
Song Pai?

00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:24.477
Useless fool!

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.323
You kidnapped the wrong person.

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:31.400
We already have him. Maybe we just…

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.477
Even if you want to die,

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.438
don't drag me down with you.

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:37.323
Let him go. Now.

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:40.938
And. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.515
don't you dare expose me.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:43.515
If you do,

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:45.631
you'll lose both your money

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.131
and your life.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:52.477
Bah!

00:01:53.438 --> 00:01:54.592
Who do you think you are?

00:01:54.977 --> 00:01:56.169
I'm not your servant

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.054
to order around.

00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.323
Crazy woman.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.438
So what if you're the First Prince?

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:14.246
Huh?

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:16.246
I'd like to see
who's coming to save you now.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:19.477
Hmph.

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:22.131
Your Highness,

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.323
if you die,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.160
do you really think
that little wretched Mengmeng

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:29.169
will make it out of Manbo Kingdom alive?

00:02:46.054 --> 00:02:46.823
You two…

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.054
Do you even know who I am?

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.323
You punk!

00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:05.669
You dare steal our boss's woman?

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:09.092
The punk you're talking about

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:11.592
is the First Prince of Manbo Kingdom.

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.054
If you're a prince,

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:16.246
then I'm your dad.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.554
Is he really a prince?

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:32.823
- No way!
- No way!

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:34.708
What's wrong?

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:35.823
Sir,

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:36.631
please sit.

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:37.592
Please sit, sir.

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:40.015
You can

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:40.554
untie me now.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:41.785
My hands are numb.

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:43.054
Sorry, sir.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:45.015
Please sit.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.938
Massage my shoulders and neck.

00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:50.400
Do a good job and I'll make you
captain of the royal guards.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.120
Captain of the Royal Guards
of Manbo Kingdom.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:52.900
Thank you, sir.

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.477
My hands are a bit numb.

00:03:56.823 --> 00:03:57.390
That will do.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.823
Does that feel good?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.477
Is this okay, sir?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.390
Put some strength into it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.192
I see how it is.

00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:12.385
You play dirty.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.360
You want to fight me?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.600
Try again in your next life.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.457
Baofan!

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:24.298
Zhong Cheng, how could you hit me?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.452
What are you doing?

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:26.298
Zhong Cheng!

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:27.452
Sir!

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.490
Oh my goodness!

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:30.183
You actually hit me!

00:04:30.414 --> 00:04:31.221
I didn't hit you.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:31.990
Baofan!

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:35.798
We're on the same side.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:37.567
Who hit you?

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:38.260
He did.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.837
Who hit you?

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.875
What's your problem? I didn't hit you!

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.183
Ah!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.567
He…

00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:46.490
He was about to whip me with his belt.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.298
Zhong Cheng!

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:48.529
I didn't hit him!

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:49.721
I didn't touch him at all!

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.029
Don't listen to his nonsense!

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.644
What's wrong?

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:19.760
It might be an internal injury…

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.837
An internal injury?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.567
No…

00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:24.990
You're fine.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.875
Mengmeng, don't leave.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:26.529
I'm not leaving.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.546
This is all my fault.

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:30.030
If it weren't for…

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.738
If it weren't for…

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.238
If it weren't for Zhong Cheng
asking me out

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:33.431
and me wanting to catch him,

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:35.431
I… I wouldn't have shown up.

00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:36.123
It's okay.

00:05:36.123 --> 00:05:36.777
I'm fine.

00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:37.738
I'm sorry.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.354
Just stay with me.

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:40.161
I'm staying.

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:40.469
Mengmeng.

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.260
I'll be right here.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.330
I'm not going anywhere.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:45.931
I'm sorry.

00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:46.900
I'll stay with you.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.700
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:04.200
This was my mistake.

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.585
I meant to kidnap Guan Mengmeng

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.508
and force Song Pai
to stop the fundraising,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.123
but I didn't expect…

00:06:10.623 --> 00:06:11.661
I didn't expect you

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.661
and your useless subordinates

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:15.123
to kidnap the wrong person.

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:16.046
Absurd.

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:25.661
You've disappointed me.

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:29.546
Lin Ge?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.008
Why are you here?

00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.123
Mother.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.880
What is it this time
that made you punish Nana?

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:36.931
I had no choice.

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:39.046
But you can't do this to her every time…

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:39.738
It's my honor

00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.315
to receive Mother's guidance.

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:50.161
Mother,

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.469
if you ever torture Nana again,

00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:54.392
I will turn against you.

00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:58.623
Lin Ge!

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.070
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:00.777
Come back!

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:01.700
Get back here!

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:12.800
Boss,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.646
we've confirmed it.

00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:15.360
Zhong Cheng works
for the Second Princess.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.390
For now, we don't know where he is.

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:18.454
Wen Shanna again.

00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:20.992
I got it. You're dismissed.

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:48.721
Why is it still dark?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.380
(Dark?)

00:07:50.183 --> 00:07:51.606
(He must still be delirious.)

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:53.029
Guan Mengmeng.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.220
Mengmeng!

00:07:57.337 --> 00:07:59.290
I can't see. Mengmeng, where are you?

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.980
Song Pai.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.420
Mengmeng!

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.613
I'm here.

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:02.460
I can't see.

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:03.960
I'm right here, Song Pai.

00:08:04.113 --> 00:08:06.498
Why can't I see anything?

00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:08.921
Good grief…

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:10.960
Song Pai!

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.690
How many fingers am I holding up?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.113
How many?

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.498
One.

00:08:15.498 --> 00:08:16.152
Look.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.267
- How many fingers am I…
- I can't see, Mengmeng!

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:20.383
Call the doctor, Mengmeng!

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.915
Doctor, how is he?

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:31.761
His Highness…

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.208
Your Highness,
I'm afraid you've gone blind.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.490
I'll go get some medicine for you.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.020
All right…

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.162
Guan Mengmeng…

00:08:46.354 --> 00:08:48.277
You wouldn't abandon me, would you?

00:08:48.508 --> 00:08:49.585
I wouldn't.

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:50.546
I would never.

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:51.931
Don't worry.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:52.585
Really?

00:08:52.854 --> 00:08:53.508
Yes.

00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:54.680
You'll get your eyesight back.

00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:56.585
The doctor said so.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.354
He went to prepare your medicine.

00:08:58.354 --> 00:08:59.239
I don't believe it.

00:09:00.431 --> 00:09:01.431
You will get better.

00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:02.180
I don't believe it.

00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:04.393
Isn't that how it always goes
in the movies?

00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:06.431
The male lead goes blind
and the female lead leaves.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.662
I won't stop you
if you really want to go, Mengmeng.

00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:10.931
What are you going on about?

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:12.239
Oh, baby.

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:13.190
I would never leave you.

00:09:18.623 --> 00:09:20.700
I won't abandon you. Don't worry.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.393
Let me apply the medicine.

00:09:24.546 --> 00:09:25.239
Be good.

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:26.290
Let's apply the medicine.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.790
Father, there's no need for formalities.

00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:49.777
Protocol cannot be neglected.

00:09:51.893 --> 00:09:52.546
Greetings,

00:09:53.277 --> 00:09:55.508
Second Princess.

00:09:57.393 --> 00:09:58.662
Father, please be seated.

00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:12.008
Sit with me, my dear.

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:14.816
Father.

00:10:15.662 --> 00:10:17.316
I haven't finished raising the funds

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.623
for the Second Prince yet.

00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:21.623
You don't need to explain.

00:10:22.893 --> 00:10:24.431
You are the most

00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:27.700
outstanding woman
of your generation in our family.

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:29.585
For now,

00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:31.239
endure what comes from the Queen.

00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:33.470
When you become Queen yourself one day,

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:35.931
there will be no need
to endure anything.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.585
Thank you
for your understanding, Father.

00:10:39.854 --> 00:10:42.085
As for that Guan Mengmeng…

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.777
How dare she make a fool of my daughter.

00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:48.277
Father,

00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:51.777
don't you think there's something
strange about Guan Mengmeng?

00:10:52.508 --> 00:10:53.739
Do you think it's because

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:55.931
she hails from
that mysterious Eastern nation?

00:10:57.777 --> 00:10:58.931
One Guan Mengmeng is nothing

00:10:58.931 --> 00:10:59.854
to fear.

00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:02.585
Your priority right now

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.277
is to become Queen.

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.085
Once you are Queen,

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:09.508
our family's position will be secure.

00:11:09.893 --> 00:11:11.316
You will bring honor

00:11:11.623 --> 00:11:13.508
to our family.

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:16.046
Father.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.390
I'm afraid I won't be able
to live up to your expectations.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:20.777
Nana,

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:22.854
you're my daughter.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.695
I believe you have what it takes.

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:28.564
No one but you

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:30.487
can shoulder this responsibility

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:31.834
and ensure

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.603
our family's prosperity for generations.

00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:34.757
Nana,

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.103
you must not let me

00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:39.603
and the entire family down.

00:11:41.564 --> 00:11:42.564
I know, Father.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.834
(I must uphold my family's honor.)

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.872
(But I don't know how much longer
I can endure this pressure.)

00:11:57.757 --> 00:11:58.218
Oh?

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:00.026
First Princess,

00:12:00.295 --> 00:12:02.526
fancy seeing you here.

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:07.564
If I were you,

00:12:07.564 --> 00:12:09.064
I'd stop playing tricks.

00:12:09.872 --> 00:12:10.949
It's better for you

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.564
to keep your distance from Zhong Cheng.

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:14.026
You know,

00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:15.795
I quite envy you.

00:12:15.795 --> 00:12:17.218
That you can live

00:12:17.218 --> 00:12:18.757
so freely.

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:21.103
Do you?

00:12:21.526 --> 00:12:22.257
Here's my warning.

00:12:23.257 --> 00:12:27.064
I won't give up the succession
over some empty dream.

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:30.026
The position of Crown Prince
belongs to Lin Ge alone.

00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:31.987
And the title of Queen

00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:36.257
will only ever be mine.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.177
Then, let's see how it ends.

00:12:58.215 --> 00:12:59.062
Wen!

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.215
Let's go!

00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:01.985
If we don't leave now,
it'll be too late.

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:02.638
Come on.

00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:06.754
What's wrong?

00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:15.446
What's the matter, Wen?

00:13:16.408 --> 00:13:17.408
Didn't we promise

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.177
to run away together,

00:13:19.485 --> 00:13:21.254
to escape this place?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.177
Wen?

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:27.292
Rui.

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:30.900
You're the officially designated
future Queen of Manbo Kingdom.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.100
We can't escape.

00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:35.869
I won't listen to that.

00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:37.754
I won't have it!

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.177
You promised.

00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:43.754
You promised you'd take me away, Wen.

00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:46.446
You promised we'd escape together.

00:13:46.677 --> 00:13:47.254
Come on!

00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:48.331
Let's go!

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:49.369
Look at me!

00:13:52.638 --> 00:13:54.023
Where can we escape to?

00:13:54.177 --> 00:13:55.408
There's no escape for us.

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:03.446
Wen Shanna!

00:14:04.023 --> 00:14:04.790
What are you doing?

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:06.023
Let me go!

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:13.985
Release her!

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.720
Are you all right, Mengmeng?

00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:17.869
What happened to me?

00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:22.408
Guan Mengmeng, what did you do
to me this time?

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.677
You did this last time too.
What are you…

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:25.177
Wen Shanna, mind your place.

00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:27.138
Song Pai!

00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:28.523
You lied to me again!

00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:30.600
You're supposed to be blind!

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.062
What's going on here?
