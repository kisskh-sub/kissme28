WEBVTT

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:11.010
So, do you like him or what?

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:13.758
Not to the point of liking him yet. I just want to get to know him better.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.100
Do you think Fah knows it’s you?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.945
If it were the real Typhoon, he wouldn’t even be able to talk to P'Fah.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.555
You’re afraid of losing P'Fah.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:24.874
But aren’t you afraid P'Fah might fall for someone else?

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:26.582
Of course I am.

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:30.122
What’s wrong with you, Fah? You usually accept things from anyone, don’t you?

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:32.274
Because there’s already someone in his heart now.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.197
How could he casually accept things from others?

00:00:34.413 --> 00:00:35.878
Happy birthday.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.924
Thank you.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:22.016
- Good morning, Doctor Fah.
- Good morning.

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:23.761
Here you go.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.997
Here you are.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.019
Happy birthday.

00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:41.357
You must have received plenty of birthday wishes already.

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:44.392
But please allow me to be one more person praying for you.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:45.914
Whether it’s your studies,

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:47.318
or your work,

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.874
you’re already amazing.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.648
I hope you get some time to rest as well.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.188
And be very happy.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:57.758
Because your smile is one of the wonders of this world.

00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.602
I bought a Polaroid camera as your birthday present.

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:02.611
If it’s not too much trouble,

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.842
I’d like to invite you to take photos together.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.801
So we can share photos from our everyday lives.

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:11.000
But if it’s inconvenient, that’s totally fine.

00:03:12.407 --> 00:03:13.687
Just accepting it

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.374
already makes me very happy.

00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:30.117
So, how was it?

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:32.395
Mm.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:33.872
I think it’s the same person.

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:40.419
I think I’ve found the person from the letters.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.900
No.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:43.905
He came to me himself.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:46.811
Don’t you recognize his handwriting?

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:52.860
Phoon’s handwriting didn’t look like this before.
Or did he change it on purpose so I wouldn’t recognize it?

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:54.962
But after writing for a while, he must’ve gotten used to it.

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:57.222
So when he wrote the birthday card, he slipped up.

00:03:58.591 --> 00:03:59.804
What do you think about him?

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:06.282
I used to think of Phoon as nothing more than a younger brother.

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:09.481
A kid next door I wanted to take the best care of.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.691
But you know he’s never seen you as just a brother.

00:04:13.468 --> 00:04:14.376
I know.

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.312
And I’m sure Phoon knows it too.

00:04:17.776 --> 00:04:20.337
But after all this happened,

00:04:20.682 --> 00:04:22.391
it feels like I’ve gotten to know another side of Phoon.

00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:25.632
A side that’s not just the little brother he’s always been.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.752
So how do you feel about him now?

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.490
I like the person from the letters.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:34.487
If that person is Phoon,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.525
then I guess I like Phoon.

00:04:38.762 --> 00:04:39.691
That’s really all there is to it.

00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:41.368
Aren’t you mad at him?

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:42.985
For not being honest with you?

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.577
I—

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.911
I’m actually happy.

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:48.014
That it’s Phoon.

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:50.074
So what are you going to do now?

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.330
Are you just going to stay the same and wait for him to confess?

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.893
I—

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:00.425
I used to think I was patient enough to wait.

00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:03.050
But now I’m not so sure anymore.

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.494
Why is P'Fah so kind?

00:05:12.952 --> 00:05:14.220
He even remembered.

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:15.914
That I’m afraid of the dark.

00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:21.120
Are you sure you can still tutor like this? You’re really not okay.

00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:24.309
I honestly don’t know how I should act.

00:05:24.847 --> 00:05:26.014
Just act normal.

00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:28.933
Smile, stay calm, and be normal.

00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:30.488
Nothing should happen. You can do it.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.992
Stay strong. You’ll get through this. Trust me.

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.094
- Easter.
- Yes.

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:41.906
Shall we go now?

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:44.542
Yes, let’s go.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.300
What about Phoon?

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:48.460
Are you coming with us?

00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:52.364
Oh, you guys go ahead. I need to take care of something first.

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:56.524
Phoon, where’s the pen you borrowed from me?

00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:58.659
The pen I borrowed? Oh, I’ll find it.

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:00.773
- Found it.
- Okay.

00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.921
See you. Bye.

00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:06.093
- Want this too?
- Just take it.

00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.062
Let’s go.

00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:09.749
Aren’t we fighting over food now?

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.739
P’Gib, here you go.

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:16.934
Okay.

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:20.958
Hey, don’t go yet.

00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:24.459
Doctor Fah asked me to make cocoa for someone special.

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:25.891
Wait a moment. I’ll make it for you.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.122
Oh, okay.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.967
So?

00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:33.254
How’s your relationship going?

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:37.164
- It’s good.
- That’s good.

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:39.623
I’ve seen you two exchanging letters for quite a while.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.185
There’s bound to be some progress.

00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:42.948
Yes.

00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:56.122
It’s ready. Cocoa for someone special.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.306
Someone special?

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:10.631
Well, Typhoon is a special customer of my cafe.

00:07:13.408 --> 00:07:14.770
I just came to pick something up.

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:18.880
- Did he bring it today yet?
- Oh, yeah. He already did.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.976
You’re here at an unusual time today, Fah.

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:26.099
I usually see you in the morning.

00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:28.518
I just happened to be free.

00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:33.168
And…

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.472
Have you treated him to cocoa yet?

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:38.093
Uh—

00:07:38.665 --> 00:07:41.650
Of course I have. I wouldn’t forget.

00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:46.688
Phoon’s tutoring with friends at the café today, right?

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.309
Oh, yes.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.229
Go with me then.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.925
Okay.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.927
Let’s go.

00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:14.497
Phoon.

00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:17.222
Yes?

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:18.841
How have you been?

00:08:19.737 --> 00:08:21.280
I’ve been well.

00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:23.180
What about you, P'Fah?

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:24.680
I’m doing well too.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.226
If there’s anything at all,

00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:28.693
you can always tell me.

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:36.656
I didn’t pass the medical school exam.

00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:38.586
I’m sorry.

00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:40.594
Why are you apologizing?

00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:43.171
I mean, you worked so hard tutoring me.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.383
Are you okay?

00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:49.906
At first, I was a little disappointed.

00:08:50.044 --> 00:08:55.097
But now I think maybe this outcome is for the best.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:56.720
Why is that?

00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:00.133
I think I’ll take the entrance exam for a faculty I actually like.

00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:07.990
I just made an important decision in my life, even though I can’t say what it is.

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:11.462
But thinking about you gave me more courage.

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:15.417
That’s amazing.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.545
Thank you.

00:09:44.998 --> 00:09:47.333
Thank you for stepping in to help yesterday.

00:09:48.517 --> 00:09:50.320
You already thanked me yesterday.

00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:52.294
P'Fah…

00:09:52.416 --> 00:09:53.634
You even remembered.

00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:55.863
That I’m afraid of thunder.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.995
And afraid of the dark.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.903
Of course I remembered.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.314
When the power went out,

00:10:02.788 --> 00:10:06.007
the first thing I thought was, “What about Phoon?”

00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:07.437
"Where is Phoon?"

00:10:07.797 --> 00:10:09.482
When I realized you’d gone to the restroom,

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.053
I went looking for you right away.

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:12.546
P'Fah…

00:10:13.954 --> 00:10:15.094
Over the past year,

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.915
I’ve grown up so much.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.216
I know.

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:22.933
You’ve done really well.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.856
Aren’t you going to ask me?

00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:27.568
About why, back then, I…

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.114
Do you want to tell me?

00:10:34.577 --> 00:10:36.222
If not, you don’t have to.

00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:37.792
I believe that

00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:39.939
you must have had your reasons.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.042
Whenever you’re ready,

00:10:41.202 --> 00:10:42.312
you can tell me then.

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:45.096
I'm…

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:49.165
I'm afraid that you're still angry.

00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:53.136
I’m not angry at you.

00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:55.765
Don’t overthink it.

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:07.669
The shirt is really nice, but it’s too loose. I can’t wear it.

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:12.770
What is it?

00:11:13.848 --> 00:11:15.463
I was just thinking…

00:11:27.411 --> 00:11:28.882
You really are tiny.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.155
With P'Fah, it’s probably…

00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:45.785
- Back to how it used to be.
- Like before?

00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:49.180
I mean, yesterday, P'Fah…

00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:51.600
patted my head and said,

00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:53.825
“You’re really tiny.”

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:57.401
Wait, isn’t “tiny” just a polite way of saying “short”?

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:00.857
North, why are you killing the mood?

00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:04.613
He meant it affectionately, idiot.
Seriously.

00:12:05.454 --> 00:12:08.585
Anyway, let’s focus on the “head pat” part.

00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:09.795
What about it?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.151
Hey.

00:12:12.957 --> 00:12:14.510
Why are you making that face?

00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:20.752
I lied to P'Fah about Fun.

00:12:22.213 --> 00:12:24.915
If he finds out, he’ll definitely be mad.

00:12:25.238 --> 00:12:26.426
So you’re going to tell him

00:12:26.797 --> 00:12:29.551
About P'Fun?

00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:33.075
I just don’t want to lie anymore.

00:12:34.745 --> 00:12:37.080
I think that’s good. When you go talk to him,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.502
you can apologize to him again.

00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:40.918
I think it’ll be fine.

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:43.075
You’re sincere, after all.

00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:45.032
I guess that’s what I’ll do.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.631
Hey, guys.

00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:51.130
Today,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.690
let’s go reading.

00:12:53.103 --> 00:12:54.727
Dao, come with us.

00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:57.872
No, I’ve got work to do.

00:12:59.607 --> 00:13:03.110
- I was broke too, and I’m not even taking jobs like that.
- Not working? You used to.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.288
Sure. You just happened to meet P'Jo. Lucky you, that’s all.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.752
Yeah, yeah. It’s your head that’s messed up right now.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:15.109
Here.

00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:18.161
I’m still choosing.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.248
What does that have to do with you?

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:22.592
Hey, let me see too.

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.140
North, don’t push. Move.

00:13:26.628 --> 00:13:28.054
Let me see. Why are you so stingy?

00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.488
Whoa.

00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:33.167
Is that a picture of the sun?

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:34.882
This is—

00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:39.071
Isn’t this Phoon’s sky?

00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:42.648
– North, stop. You’re going overboard.
– Why are you stopping me?

00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:44.037
Look at how you’re acting.

00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:47.231
– Let’s hurry up and eat before P’Fah sees.
– Yeah, hurry up.

00:13:48.164 --> 00:13:50.180
Eat fast. P’Fah’s coming.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.682
More? Here, take it.

00:13:52.997 --> 00:13:54.364
Finish everything.

00:13:54.989 --> 00:13:55.964
All of it.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:02.085
– You started it.
– I’m not a dog.

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:07.325
– Bye, P’Gib! Bye!
– Bye!

00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:09.484
I’ll come get a new coupon tomorrow.

00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:11.931
My cafe’s coupons are almost gone.

00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:27.340
Fah.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.940
You’ve been coming in the evening for two days now.

00:14:31.066 --> 00:14:33.171
Were you waiting on purpose?

00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:34.509
No.

00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:36.392
I wanted him to leave first.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.722
So we wouldn’t run into each other.

00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:39.613
Okay, wait a moment.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.503
Okay.

00:14:44.828 --> 00:14:45.466
Here you go.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.890
Why didn’t you come in the morning like usual?

00:14:48.438 --> 00:14:50.700
I was going to pick someone up on the way.

00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:53.653
It’s nothing. I’ll go now.

00:14:58.357 --> 00:14:59.349
Pick someone up?

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:02.826
Want some?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.290
P’Hill, do you want some?

00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:22.053
Hey, Fah. What should we eat this evening?

00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:23.451
No idea.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.550
You guys aren’t helping at all.

00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:29.493
Go ask your wife.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.902
I just saw him wandering around here.

00:15:32.385 --> 00:15:33.625
He went to the bathroom.

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:39.700
North probably spoils Ter.

00:15:40.282 --> 00:15:41.217
Me?

00:15:41.745 --> 00:15:42.417
Ugh.

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:45.060
I don’t want to fight with North.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.401
Then sushi is fine.

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:51.208
– Which place?
– The one in front of the campus?

00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:53.994
It just opened. The reviews say it’s really good.

00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:55.537
Sounds good. Let’s go.

00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:58.448
You guys go ahead. I’ll wait for North.

00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:02.177
Phoon, come with us.

00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:04.789
You can go with me.

00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:12.475
Then I’ll go with P’Fah.

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:15.007
Sure. See you at the restaurant.

00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:17.211
Hurry up.

00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:19.669
Let’s go. See you.

00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:21.074
– I’ll carry it for you.
– See you at the restaurant.

00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:22.672
Oh, thank you.

00:16:24.622 --> 00:16:25.469
Just go.

00:16:25.795 --> 00:16:27.484
– Want some?
– No.

00:16:42.365 --> 00:16:43.284
Thank you.

00:16:56.897 --> 00:16:59.342
Phoon, could you grab the blue paper bag for me?

00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:12.690
Uh…

00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:16.598
Could you take the stuff inside out?

00:17:21.962 --> 00:17:23.348
What’s inside?

00:17:30.272 --> 00:17:31.120
Photos.

00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:34.368
A letter and some snacks.

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:37.429
What kind of photos?

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:39.285
Flowers.

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:44.315
Could you read the letter to me?

00:17:45.687 --> 00:17:47.485
Uh… is that okay?

00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:48.539
Yes.

00:17:48.774 --> 00:17:52.635
I want to know what it says, but I’m driving.

00:17:52.924 --> 00:17:54.862
Could you read it for me?

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:10.893
The flowers I’ve been taking care of for months have finally bloomed.

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:12.688
They’re really beautiful.

00:18:13.524 --> 00:18:16.220
I couldn’t help but take photos to share with you.

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:20.005
If you’re interested in growing some,

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:23.291
I’d be happy to recommend how.

00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:29.367
Final exams are coming up, so you must be studying hard.

00:18:29.927 --> 00:18:31.573
I am too.

00:18:32.318 --> 00:18:35.454
Hang in there.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.734
Let’s get through finals together.

00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:44.364
Is that all?

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.257
Uh, P’Fah.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.337
Weren’t we supposed to eat sushi with the others?

00:19:19.629 --> 00:19:20.811
This place is good.

00:19:21.358 --> 00:19:22.562
I wanted you to try it.

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:25.780
Oh.

00:19:30.724 --> 00:19:31.782
Okay.

00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:48.992
Here.

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:02.632
P’Fah.

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:04.191
Yes?

00:20:05.358 --> 00:20:08.207
If I start over as a first-year student,

00:20:08.765 --> 00:20:09.832
would it be a waste of time?

00:20:15.032 --> 00:20:15.934
No.

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:18.425
If it means getting to know yourself better,

00:20:18.863 --> 00:20:20.120
and knowing what you truly want to study.

00:20:20.657 --> 00:20:21.637
What do you like.

00:20:22.269 --> 00:20:24.235
No matter what it is, I think it’s worth it.

00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:29.234
So then—

00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:30.915
what faculty are you planning to transfer to?

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:32.090
Have you decided yet?

00:20:33.308 --> 00:20:34.703
I want to study photography.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.282
That’s good.

00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:38.632
You like it, after all.

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:42.300
By the way—

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.185
that faculty—

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:46.942
doesn’t it require Arts–Language Program scores?

00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:49.567
Have you been preparing for a long time?

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:51.045
Well—

00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:52.552
I just started studying.

00:20:53.082 --> 00:20:53.825
But—

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.998
I’m afraid I won’t remember everything in time.

00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:06.746
Phoon…

00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:10.385
Do you want me to tutor you?

00:21:13.118 --> 00:21:14.290
Would that really be okay?

00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:17.807
Of course.

00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:21.611
But this time—

00:21:22.668 --> 00:21:24.223
I’m not letting you run away anywhere.

00:21:29.598 --> 00:21:30.841
In that case—

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:32.324
I’ll be in your care, then.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.477
Sure.

00:21:41.045 --> 00:21:41.734
Thank you.

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.349
About—

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:56.431
the letters—

00:21:58.961 --> 00:21:59.700
yes?

00:22:04.733 --> 00:22:06.362
You can ask. Why?

00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:12.232
Whose are they?

00:22:17.075 --> 00:22:17.850
I don’t know.

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.862
You’ve been talking, but you don’t even know who he is?

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:26.968
That’s right.

00:22:27.709 --> 00:22:29.740
I barely know anything about him.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.922
He didn’t tell you anything about himself?

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:35.437
No.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.481
I asked, but he wouldn’t say.

00:22:38.728 --> 00:22:39.377
That’s too bad.

00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:42.186
But it’s okay, really.

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:43.902
If he’s comfortable—

00:22:44.534 --> 00:22:46.228
I'm okay with everything.

00:22:49.718 --> 00:22:50.724
And—

00:22:51.656 --> 00:22:53.118
how long have you been talking?

00:22:54.493 --> 00:22:55.743
About—

00:22:56.143 --> 00:22:57.355
two months now.

00:22:58.992 --> 00:22:59.746
Well—

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.167
that’s quite a while.

00:23:05.623 --> 00:23:06.896
Actually,

00:23:07.189 --> 00:23:08.973
I want to keep talking longer.

00:23:20.444 --> 00:23:21.251
That’s nice.

00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:22.208
Hmm?

00:23:23.065 --> 00:23:23.819
What’s nice?

00:23:25.324 --> 00:23:26.084
Oh—

00:23:26.496 --> 00:23:27.586
I mean—

00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:29.782
the person who—

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.545
writes the letters.

00:23:31.933 --> 00:23:33.072
He’s kind of cute.

00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:34.397
But—

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:36.368
these days, not many people—

00:23:36.974 --> 00:23:38.995
write letters to talk anymore.

00:23:39.182 --> 00:23:40.053
Mm.

00:23:41.663 --> 00:23:44.404
But it does have its downsides.

00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:46.459
When you want to meet—

00:23:47.032 --> 00:23:48.579
you can’t.

00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:50.982
When you want to hear his voice—

00:23:51.402 --> 00:23:52.429
you can’t.

00:23:54.134 --> 00:23:55.352
And another thing—

00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:57.915
if one day he disappears—

00:23:58.317 --> 00:23:59.182
I—

00:23:59.662 --> 00:24:01.210
wouldn’t know what to do.

00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:07.696
If he really disappeared—

00:24:08.568 --> 00:24:10.208
he’d be pretty heartless, wouldn’t he?

00:24:14.573 --> 00:24:15.697
Heartless?

00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:19.160
Of course.

00:24:19.557 --> 00:24:21.420
After making someone like him this much—

00:24:21.629 --> 00:24:22.942
and then just disappearing.

00:24:23.448 --> 00:24:24.890
If that’s not heartless—

00:24:25.105 --> 00:24:26.254
what would you call it?

00:24:27.605 --> 00:24:29.939
People should learn to take responsibility for other feelings.

00:24:32.448 --> 00:24:33.198
Right?

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:32.765
Fun.

00:25:33.222 --> 00:25:35.208
I'm really happy to have today.

00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:39.967
I once thought my life would have no meaning anymore—

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:41.494
when Fun wasn’t by my side.

00:25:42.928 --> 00:25:44.088
But in the end—

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.727
I got to meet everyone.

00:25:45.976 --> 00:25:47.733
I learned so many things.

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:50.380
And that’s how I realized that being alive—

00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:52.019
is already the best thing.

00:25:53.225 --> 00:25:55.530
I once thought the rain would never stop.

00:25:56.506 --> 00:25:58.194
But when it finally did—

00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.857
the sky was truly beautiful.

00:26:01.835 --> 00:26:03.330
It was worth the wait.

00:26:05.362 --> 00:26:07.075
Waiting for a brighter sky.

00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:34.168
The point is—you know P'Fah likes him,

00:26:34.502 --> 00:26:36.091
but the guy from the letters doesn’t know yet.

00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:39.100
So what are you gonna do?

00:26:39.776 --> 00:26:41.370
Keep sending letters like this?

00:26:42.044 --> 00:26:42.988
I think that’s the only way, yeah.

00:26:43.792 --> 00:26:45.185
We’ve come this far already.

00:26:45.866 --> 00:26:48.586
And P'Fah even told you he likes him already.

00:26:52.214 --> 00:26:55.597
I’m so happy the letter plan worked out for Maew.

00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:56.832
Worked out?

00:26:58.885 --> 00:26:59.712
Me, really?

00:27:00.641 --> 00:27:03.708
Maew, we’re already this far—have some confidence in yourself.

00:27:03.891 --> 00:27:10.068
- You’re basically about to ask him to be your boyfriend already. Hey, why’d you hit me?
- He's shy.

00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:12.188
Wow, you’re really blushing hard.

00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:14.500
Caught you.

00:27:14.845 --> 00:27:17.173
But seriously, P'Fah is no joke.

00:27:17.659 --> 00:27:18.841
He’s pretty clear about it too.

00:27:21.327 --> 00:27:22.213
Hey, guys.

00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:23.822
I’ve got something to tell you.

00:27:24.161 --> 00:27:24.711
Hmm?

00:27:33.154 --> 00:27:35.577
- I’m going to drop out.
- What? You’ve got kidney stones?

00:27:35.709 --> 00:27:36.685
Drop out.

00:27:36.949 --> 00:27:39.400
Seriously, you’re never serious at the right time.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.183
I thought you said kidney stones.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.545
You’re really dropping out?

00:27:43.085 --> 00:27:43.933
Yeah.

00:27:44.308 --> 00:27:46.642
I already applied for the photography exam.

00:27:49.429 --> 00:27:51.438
So it’ll just be me and Foam left together.

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.065
If it’s just you two, don’t fight, okay?

00:27:55.386 --> 00:27:58.345
- Yeah.
- But I’m kinda sad.

00:27:59.072 --> 00:28:00.881
I won’t be with you guys anymore.

00:28:03.471 --> 00:28:06.737
Come on, you’re being dramatic.

00:28:06.954 --> 00:28:08.478
We’ll still see each other anyway, right?

00:28:08.952 --> 00:28:10.198
- Yeah.
- True.

00:28:11.968 --> 00:28:13.782
We’re really happy for you, Maew.

00:28:14.072 --> 00:28:16.082
That you finally chose your own path.

00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:23.112
Won’t your dad say anything about it?

00:28:23.647 --> 00:28:25.696
Especially now that you’re talking to p"Fah again.

00:28:28.085 --> 00:28:29.518
Whatever happens, happens.

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:32.296
Well…

00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:34.730
If my dad won’t pay for me to study photography,

00:28:35.404 --> 00:28:39.379
I’ll just do freelance photography or something.

00:28:41.764 --> 00:28:43.665
I never wanted to rely on him forever anyway.

00:28:46.457 --> 00:28:47.973
It’s okay. You’ve got us.

00:28:48.434 --> 00:28:49.657
Don’t pressure yourself too much.

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:53.005
You’re already amazing for deciding this much.

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:57.040
Yeah, I think I’m pretty amazing too.

00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:59.214
Both for being born

00:28:59.687 --> 00:29:00.740
and for everything about Fun.

00:29:02.663 --> 00:29:06.958
For every time my dad blamed me, even when I did nothing wrong.

00:29:09.128 --> 00:29:12.604
I used to think that if one day I lost my mom and Fun,

00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:14.551
I wouldn’t want to lose my dad too.

00:29:15.105 --> 00:29:18.131
Until I started losing myself.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.635
Damn, that’s handsome.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.271
Hey.

00:29:40.908 --> 00:29:42.481
Daotok, wanna go eat?

00:29:42.831 --> 00:29:45.602
Nah, I’m going back to my room to work.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:47.020
Look at him.

00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:47.936
Wow.

00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:50.303
Always ditching his friends.

00:29:51.017 --> 00:29:52.902
Do you know how lonely we are?

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:56.349
- For real.
- I see you two eating with your boyfriends every day.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.869
When do you even have time to be lonely?

00:30:00.008 --> 00:30:01.657
Wow, you really can talk.

00:30:02.025 --> 00:30:06.579
I know it—you secretly went to eat together, just the two of you and P'Fah, right?

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:07.921
Yeah.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.703
That day I ordered tons of sushi. So what, you made me to eat everything.

00:30:11.802 --> 00:30:13.259
True. He must paid for that.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.136
So now that Typhoon and P'Fah are good again,

00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:23.371
how’s the situation with the letter person?

00:30:24.757 --> 00:30:26.552
- Answer me.
- It’s going okay.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.536
Caught you.

00:30:29.142 --> 00:30:30.337
What does “going okay” mean?

00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:38.085
Are you really not going to tell P'Fah?

00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:44.051
I’m scared that if I tell him, P'Fah will be disappointed.

00:30:44.194 --> 00:30:44.893
Hey.

00:30:45.256 --> 00:30:46.219
No way.

00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:47.807
You never know though, right?

00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:50.598
I don’t think P'Fah would be disappointed.

00:30:51.045 --> 00:30:53.822
P'Fah really seems to like the person in the letters, Phoon.

00:30:53.927 --> 00:30:55.208
Yeah.

00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:56.517
I think so too.

00:30:56.752 --> 00:30:59.699
Thanks. I feel better now. I trust Dao.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.245
Hey, I said the same thing.

00:31:02.674 --> 00:31:03.925
- Why don’t you trust me?
- Huh?

00:31:04.494 --> 00:31:06.605
What the hell, let’s go.

00:31:06.776 --> 00:31:08.641
You never believe anything I say.

00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:10.063
What are you even saying?

00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:04.395
Would it be possible if I wanted to see you just once?

00:33:21.318 --> 00:33:22.853
Do you think Phoon will come see you?

00:33:24.355 --> 00:33:25.122
He will.

00:33:25.348 --> 00:33:26.768
Why are you so confident about that?

00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:31.736
What kind of plan do you have?

00:33:39.188 --> 00:33:40.477
About the letters…

00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:43.629
Actually, I have something I'm not sure about too.

00:33:45.808 --> 00:33:46.625
What is it?

00:33:47.527 --> 00:33:52.508
I'm not sure if that person really likes me or not.

00:33:53.515 --> 00:33:56.324
If they didn’t like you, why would they write you letters?

00:33:56.711 --> 00:33:57.875
I don’t know.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.075
- Maybe they’re writing to several people.
- No way.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:02.685
How do you know, Phoon?

00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:08.056
Just a guess.

00:34:10.936 --> 00:34:14.242
Then that means they like me, right?

00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:15.171
Yeah.

00:34:20.948 --> 00:34:22.096
Only me, right?

00:34:26.536 --> 00:34:26.983
Yeah.

00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:31.902
So that means he’ll love only me, right?

00:34:38.628 --> 00:34:39.614
What do you say?

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.260
Yes. I'm sure he’ll love P'Fah and only P'Fah.

00:34:45.546 --> 00:34:46.186
Oh.

00:34:56.288 --> 00:34:57.502
Was it fun teasing him?

00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:00.213
He was kind of cute getting teased.

00:35:01.703 --> 00:35:02.608
Look at your friend.

00:35:04.448 --> 00:35:05.771
But when you really think about it,

00:35:05.994 --> 00:35:07.749
North and Ter aren’t bad at all.

00:35:08.085 --> 00:35:09.297
They’ve totally got their friend’s back.

00:35:09.659 --> 00:35:10.847
Even if it’s not very smooth.

00:35:13.474 --> 00:35:14.842
So what do you think we should do?

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:19.213
I think Ter will already go along with Phoon anyway.

00:35:20.337 --> 00:35:21.651
He’ll probably talk him into it.

00:35:22.722 --> 00:35:24.480
But as for North,

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:26.180
he’ll likely be the one pushing him to come.

00:35:31.002 --> 00:35:33.810
I think that’s exactly why I’m confident Phoon will come—because of North.

00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:36.518
Hey, you should thank me.

00:35:37.031 --> 00:35:38.442
My wife’s doing this much for you, you know.

00:35:39.681 --> 00:35:42.471
- Ok.
- Your boyfriend does something nice and you take all the credit.

00:35:42.622 --> 00:35:43.520
Of course I do.

00:35:55.952 --> 00:35:57.096
What are you guys talking about?

00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:00.253
You’re loud as hell.

00:36:08.524 --> 00:36:11.082
And what’s wrong with you? Why do you look like Jo?

00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:13.952
How does he looks like me?

00:36:14.813 --> 00:36:17.908
You always smirk when you’ve got some evil plan, like—

00:36:19.997 --> 00:36:21.543
like “damn, I’m handsome” or something.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.437
Which—

00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:29.414
you actually are handsome, Jo.

00:36:31.416 --> 00:36:32.580
I mean,

00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:36.645
in this whole world, you’re the only one I’ll admit I’m second to.

00:36:36.902 --> 00:36:39.222
Everyone else, I think I’m better-looking.

00:36:40.189 --> 00:36:41.121
Nice save.

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.865
Isn’t it sticking out a bit?

00:36:47.183 --> 00:36:48.235
You look like a teenage mom.

00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:49.512
Tuck your stomach in a little.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.053
This right here is the ultimate level.

00:36:54.554 --> 00:36:56.930
Seriously, what are you guys doing?

00:36:57.404 --> 00:36:58.152
Disguised him

00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.303
I know it’s a disguise, but what are you doing it for?

00:37:01.674 --> 00:37:02.948
Just talk to him directly.

00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:05.949
Maew doesn’t dare face him directly, North.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.991
So you’re really going to disguise yourselves like this?

00:37:09.263 --> 00:37:11.168
- Yeah.
- You think P'Fah won’t notice?

00:37:12.957 --> 00:37:14.620
Hey, look at this.

00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:15.891
This.

00:37:16.605 --> 00:37:17.382
What do you think?

00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:20.602
If you ran into him on the street, you wouldn’t recognize him.

00:37:20.752 --> 00:37:22.602
You wouldn’t recognize him? idiot. Just look at him.

00:37:23.204 --> 00:37:25.422
Damn it, North. If you can’t recognize him, don’t act like you’re so smart.

00:37:25.687 --> 00:37:28.171
You’re not helping, and now you’re getting in the way. Seriously.

00:37:28.423 --> 00:37:31.882
Alright, alright. Don’t fight. Stop it.

00:37:32.668 --> 00:37:33.976
So, does this outfit pass?

00:37:35.328 --> 00:37:36.477
Mm, it passes.

00:37:36.576 --> 00:37:37.989
I think it passes too.

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:40.136
But I think you should take it off. It’s hot.

00:37:40.211 --> 00:37:40.840
Yeah.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.685
Okay?

00:37:41.912 --> 00:37:43.100
You’ll pass out on the actual day.

00:37:44.776 --> 00:37:45.702
Ow, ow.

00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:47.933
I think I can handle it.

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.302
You’re already panting just standing in the room.

00:37:52.509 --> 00:37:56.677
But P'Fah recognizes Maew’s voice.
So does that mean you guys can’t talk at all?

00:37:58.888 --> 00:37:59.853
Then what if—

00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:01.317
I write it in a notebook?

00:38:02.567 --> 00:38:03.334
Sure.

00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:05.442
I don’t think he’d mind that much.

00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:12.746
So have you written back yet, about agreeing to meet?

00:38:15.536 --> 00:38:16.431
Not yet.

00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.290
I don’t know what to say.

00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:23.850
Just say you’ll meet him, but with conditions.

00:38:24.334 --> 00:38:25.311
But right now,

00:38:25.917 --> 00:38:28.011
I think P'Fah is already head over heels for you.

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:30.204
Whatever you ask, he’ll probably agree to it all.

00:38:33.026 --> 00:38:34.835
Caught you.

00:38:36.823 --> 00:38:37.708
North.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.622
Me again.

00:38:45.579 --> 00:38:47.299
Thank you for wanting to meet me.

00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:49.642
I want to meet you too.

00:38:50.229 --> 00:38:51.899
It might seem a bit complicated,

00:38:52.404 --> 00:38:54.145
but I have a few conditions.

00:39:08.731 --> 00:39:09.965
Is it this place?

00:39:15.754 --> 00:39:17.091
Hey, why are you so tense?

00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:18.245
Let’s go.

00:39:23.034 --> 00:39:23.851
One.

00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:26.860
I’ll be wearing something rather unusual when I meet you.

00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:28.946
Please don’t mind it.

00:39:55.786 --> 00:39:56.628
Two.

00:39:57.459 --> 00:40:00.059
I don’t want you to try to find out who I am.

00:40:07.434 --> 00:40:08.794
Thank you for coming to meet me.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.845
Three. If you happen to find out

00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:16.078
who I am,

00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:18.844
please pretend you don’t know.

00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:25.425
I have so many things I want to tell you.

00:40:31.528 --> 00:40:32.925
I really feel at ease.

00:40:35.983 --> 00:40:37.717
You’re my safe zone.

00:40:40.284 --> 00:40:41.182
Is that okay?

00:40:42.059 --> 00:40:43.820
Can you be my safe zone?

00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:58.757
I can be anything.

00:40:59.454 --> 00:41:00.490
That’s so sweet.

00:41:01.029 --> 00:41:02.946
Why are you being this kind to me?

00:41:11.245 --> 00:41:14.085
Because you’re important to me.

00:41:16.394 --> 00:41:18.179
I really wanted to hear you say that.

00:41:27.383 --> 00:41:29.601
You’re important to me.

00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:32.275
You’re not ready yet, are you?

00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:44.137
I’m sorry.

00:41:44.764 --> 00:41:45.688
It’s okay.

00:41:46.805 --> 00:41:47.976
For now,

00:41:48.244 --> 00:41:49.574
this is enough.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.000
Has anyone ever told you

00:41:56.468 --> 00:41:57.637
that you’re really cute?

00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:03.333
Where have you been all this time?

00:42:18.337 --> 00:42:20.001
There’s something I want to ask you.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:27.731
Yes?

00:42:28.915 --> 00:42:30.617
I once wrote in my letter that

00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:32.200
the name Tonfah comes from

00:42:32.389 --> 00:42:34.117
my father wanting me to be the sky,

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.299
and my mother wanting me to be a tree.

00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:37.605
What about you?

00:42:38.075 --> 00:42:39.228
What do you want me to be?

00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:49.330
Love.

00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:07.029
Why did you want to meet me?

00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:13.822
I just wanted to know how I’d feel if I met you.

00:43:14.377 --> 00:43:15.682
And then I realized

00:43:16.189 --> 00:43:17.475
it feels really good.

00:43:19.773 --> 00:43:21.185
I want to see you often.

00:43:22.737 --> 00:43:23.718
What about you?

00:43:24.721 --> 00:43:26.600
Why did you decide to come meet me?

00:43:32.537 --> 00:43:34.420
Because you said you wanted to see me.

00:43:38.044 --> 00:43:38.930
Why?

00:43:39.595 --> 00:43:42.088
Even though you chose to hide your identity this much.

00:43:50.174 --> 00:43:52.983
I don’t really know. You just said you wanted to meet me,

00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.760
so I wanted to come see you.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.675
May I hold your hand?

00:44:13.155 --> 00:44:14.762
You’re love to me too.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.552
What’s wrong?

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.995
You don’t like it? I’m sorry.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.223
Do you want to wipe your tears first? I’ll close my eyes, okay?

00:44:58.908 --> 00:45:00.296
Have you stopped crying?

00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:19.506
It’s okay.

00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:06.869
Wait.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.514
I really like your soft lips

00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:18.232
when I kiss you.

00:47:05.462 --> 00:47:07.631
Anyway, your first time meeting—

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.571
Don’t say it.

00:47:10.755 --> 00:47:12.278
It’s been so long since we last met, P'Fah.

00:47:12.714 --> 00:47:14.813
Didn’t we just see each other yesterday?

00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:18.096
Are you free tonight?

00:47:18.471 --> 00:47:20.045
I’ll tutor you.

00:47:20.746 --> 00:47:22.515
The chance is here. Go for it.

00:47:22.992 --> 00:47:24.225
P'Fah is kind to everyone.

00:47:24.989 --> 00:47:27.894
He might really like the person from the letters.

00:47:28.161 --> 00:47:31.048
You might be wondering why I kissed you.

00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:35.023
The answer is—
