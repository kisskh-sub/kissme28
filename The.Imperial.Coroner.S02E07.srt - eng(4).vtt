(You Chen'an petitioned Your Highness
to enter the Three Judicial Offices.)

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.039
(For this reason, he also presented)

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.160
(a remarkably delicate
and rare anatomical chart.)

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.760
(The figure depicted within)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.280
(bore an uncanny resemblance
to Your Highness's features.)

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.920
(Before I could trace
the chart's origin,)

(the one Jing Yi
had long been tracking,)

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.199

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.520
(suddenly died at Zhao Residence.)

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.159
(The Zhao family
had their misgivings)

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.960
(and conspired with the monks
to conceal the matter.)

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.359
(Fortunately,)

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.399

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.440
=Episode 7= (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.439
Sir, something has happened.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.680
Commandery Prince An found

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.420
Master Shenguan's body
in the West Market.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.639
Who?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960
Master Shenguan?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.800
So the martyr was him after all.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.080
Also, the Master's body,
together with several fellow masters,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.190
has been taken by Commandery Prince An
to the Three Judicial Offices.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.240
Just as Peacock foretold,
the opportunity has arrived.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.230
I must enter the palace
to see the Tang Emperor.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.080
Yes.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.000
Your Highness.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.480
Have you noticed anything?

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.520
One cannot be certain by sight alone.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.039
An autopsy will be necessary.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.520
He is a member of the clergy,

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.759
and not a cleric of the Great Tang.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.319
That makes the matter complicated.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.240
Chen Feng.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.400
Keep watch over the body for me.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.560
No one is to touch it before I return.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.719
Clergy observe many taboos.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.680
I will ask the junior masters
and confirm them.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.960
If certain taboos
do not affect the examination,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.280
it is better to avoid them.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.700
You believe in such things as well?

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.360
I thought that with you,
there were no taboos at all.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.960
It is not that I believe in them.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.280
But examinations

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.000
are not easily accepted by everyone.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.840
Their master has just passed away,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.960
and they are in deep grief.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.240
If observing these taboos
can ease their sorrow even a little,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.280
and prevent further trouble afterward,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.520
there is no harm in doing so.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.719
Understood.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.680
Based on what you have all said,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.280
I do have my doubts.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.740
Therefore, I wish to keep the eminent monk's
remains be kept at the Three Judicial Offices

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.960
for a thorough investigation.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.439
Very well.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.940
We shall proceed
as Your Highness wishes.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.560
Envoy, you cannot go in.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.820
His Highness is questioning them inside.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:23.680
I must see him.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.470
You may not enter now.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.000
Step aside.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.120
I said, step aside.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.040
Step aside!

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.800
You may not enter now.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.000
Step aside.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.160
Step aside!

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.000
Let him in.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.519
Your Highness.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.860
Bringing disciples of the Buddhist order
here for questioning

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.680
seems inappropriate.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.920
Once they enter the Great Tang,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.680
they are bound
by the Tang laws all the same.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.990
This matter involves a criminal case.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.940
There is no alternative.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.100
They are subjects of Nanzhao.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.040
And the case concerns Master Shenguan.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.160
Should the Nanzhao envoy
not be informed first?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.519
You already know the situation.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.800
As for the case itself,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.680
once a conclusion is reached,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.860
the Three Judicial Offices
will provide an explanation.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.400
What do you think, Second Prince?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.320
Your Highness, please reconsider.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.600
If an examination is conducted
before any negotiations,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.959
then Gao Luoqian
will surely go before His Majesty

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.519
and accuse the Three Judicial Offices
from top to bottom, inside and out.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.730
Your Highness.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.110
Do you currently possess

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.360
concrete evidence
that Master Shenguan was murdered?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.920
Not yet.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.800
It is precisely because Master Shenguan
was a eminent monk of Nanzhao,

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.079
yet passed away within the Great Tang,
that I must pursue this to the end.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.830
Otherwise, there will be
no proper explanation to Nanzhao,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.079
or to the Great Tang.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.720
Then,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.639
has Weiguo Temple

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.879
already signed the documents
for the Permit of Autopsy?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.360
Second Prince.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.079
Are you speaking now
as the chief envoy of Nanzhao,

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.680
or as a member
of the Three Judicial Offices?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.319
Since you have entered
the Three Judicial Offices,

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:04.959
I will treat you

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.600
as one of us.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.720
You should likewise regard yourself

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.500
as a member
of the Three Judicial Offices.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.839
Your Highness.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.199
You intend to conduct an autopsy?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.030
That is the proper procedure
in investigating a case.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.970
How can that be allowed?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.600
According to Second Prince,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.970
we must give our consent
before any examination, is that so?

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.120
Yes.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.660
However...

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.780
This is absolutely unacceptable.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.940
- You cannot do this.
- Yes.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.190
And this is only them speaking.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.300
Commandery Prince An.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.800
The Great Tang holds Buddhism
in the highest regard.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.519
Nanzhao values it no less, if not more.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.120
If this continues,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.630
it may truly bring consequences
upon you as well.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.110
Commandery Prince An,
it seems you are not seeking the truth,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.740
but deliberately humiliating
the Buddhist order of Nanzhao.

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:43.680
How outrageous.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.740
Our master upheld
pure discipline throughout his life.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.490
As he journeys toward the Pure Land,
his body must not be desecrated.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.460
Your Highness,
I asked you to uncover the truth,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.920
but not at the cost of harming
our master's sacred body.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.720
Exactly.

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.780
This is utterly improper.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.199
Masters, please calm yourselves.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.890
Master Shenguan's body
remains intact for now.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.959
Whatever taboos
the Buddhist order observes,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.230
so long as they do not affect
the accuracy of the examination,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.279
we can discuss a proper arrangement.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.570
But allow me to say one thing as well.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.160
Protecting Master Shenguan's
remains is important,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.520
yet only by uncovering the truth

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.600
can his name truly be cleared.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.519
If the master truly died unjustly,

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.439
would you not wish to see
the culprit brought to justice?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.480
Her Highness makes a fair point.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.040
This matter surrounding
our master is indeed suspicious.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.000
An imperial decree has arrived.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.560
By His Majesty's oral command,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.600
Commandery Prince An is summoned
to enter the palace at once.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.560
I receive the decree.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.279
Wu Jiang.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.830
Guard the master's body carefully.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.680
No one is to touch it before I return.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.600
Yes.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.319
Master Shenguan
was the eminent monk of Nanzhao,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.060
who spread
the Buddhist teachings far and wide,

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.260
bringing light across Nanzhao.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.439
Now he has passed away so suddenly.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.120
As the Vice Envoy of Nanzhao,

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:10.439
I must take his remains back

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:11.600
to uncover the truth.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.079
Only then can justice be done
for Nanzhao and for the master.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:15.959
Yet now the body

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.300
is being withheld without cause
by the Three Judicial Offices.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.600
Could there be
some unspeakable reason behind this?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.959
I beg Your Majesty to render judgment.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.680
Your Majesty.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.199
Xiao Jinyu.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.720
You brought Master Shenguan's body

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.200
to the Three Judicial Offices?

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.360
Yes.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.100
The incident happened too suddenly.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:39.240
I fear that the master's death
may conceal another truth.

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.399
Another truth...

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.559
Has Commandery Prince An
uncovered anything?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.720
There are some leads,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.990
but it is not yet appropriate
to disclose them.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.360
Master Shenguan died suddenly
within the Great Tang.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.220
If it were illness,
that would be acceptable.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.590
But if he was harmed by malicious hands,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.590
then the culprit
must be someone of the Great Tang.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.519
When one's own people judge their own,

00:08:58.759 --> 00:08:59.919
where does fairness lie?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.360
Vice Envoy Gao, do not forget

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.519
that under Tang laws,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.970
foreign envoys have no authority
to conduct investigations within the Great Tang.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.440
It is precisely because
the master's status is so revered

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.990
that the Three Judicial Offices
proceed with such caution.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.360
Commandery Prince An's actions

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.140
amount to diminishing
the sanctity of the eminent monk.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.039
According to
the Buddhist customs of Nanzhao,

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:20.960
within forty nine days
after a senior monk's passing,

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:23.759
the soul has not yet
fully departed from the body.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.720
The body must be kept for seven days,
or up to twenty-one days.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.300
If the remains are handled carelessly,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.960
the master may fall directly
into the three evil paths,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.480
or even be denied rebirth.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.480
How can
the Three Judicial Offices guarantee

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.420
that the master's body
will be treated with due reverence?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.159
Your Majesty.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.080
Commandery Prince An

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.950
has long enjoyed
a reputation for integrity,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.500
and with the assistance
of the Commandery Princess Consort An,

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:50.519
he will surely safeguard
the master's remains properly,

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.080
without violating the pure precepts
of Nanzhao Buddhism.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.080
If Lord Jiang had not mentioned it,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.600
I might not have recalled it.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.960
The Great Tang
esteems ritual and propriety,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.279
yet the Three Judicial Offices
handle cases in ways that defy convention,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.200
even appointing a woman as a coroner.

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.720
This time, Your Highness,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.639
do you intend once again
to defy established norms

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.790
and have the Princess Consort
conduct the autopsy?

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:18.000
Vice Envoy Gao,
that argument does not hold.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.559
The Commandery Princess Consort An

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.690
was specially appointed by His Majesty
to serve in the Three Judicial Offices.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.799
She is, without question,
the foremost coroner of the Great Tang.

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:29.759
Having the Princess Consort
personally examine Master Shenguan

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.240
only further demonstrates

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:34.919
how seriously Commandery Prince An
takes this case.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.399
If I may speak plainly,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.519
Master Shenguan
observed pure discipline in life.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.519
How can his remains be handled
at will by a woman?

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.399
Would not
the master's lifelong reputation

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.919
be stained by this?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.090
Lord Gao, choose your words carefully.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.400
Chu Chu has worked
with me to solve many difficult cases,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.070
safeguarding the peace
of the Great Tang.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.200
Her talent rivals any man's.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.759
As an envoy, you should not
speak of her so lightly.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.679
One phrase of praise
from Commandery Prince An

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:03.639
cannot silence
the voices of all Nanzhao.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.440
The eminent monk's remains

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:08.720
are not a tool to prove
the Princess Consort's ability.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.560
Let me ask you, Commandery Prince An.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:12.440
If something were to go wrong,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.559
and public resentment were to rise,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.399
could the Princess Consort
bear that responsibility?

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.720
Enough.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:28.399
Both of you raise valid points.

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.200
This concerns a senior monk of Nanzhao.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.440
Halting the matter halfway
would only invite further criticism.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.200
The case must be investigated,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.390
but the senior monk must also
be treated with due respect.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.080
Xiao Jinyu,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.690
you will personally oversee this matter.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.960
One more thing.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.720
Since this involves Nanzhao customs,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.879
this case

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.240
is not to involve Chu Chu.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960
Do you understand?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.159
Yes.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.560
Your Majesty.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.500
What happened today

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.159
will soon spread throughout the court.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.420
If Chu Chu withdraws from the case now,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.200
would it not mean that, in the future,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.700
anyone could invoke such groundless
notions of gender propriety

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.590
to cast doubt upon her?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.470
I permitted Chu Chu to serve as a coroner
in the Three Judicial Offices

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.000
because I value her abilities.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:17.879
But if her ability

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.799
cannot outweigh the trouble
she brings to the court,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.360
then she has failed

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.840
both as an official and as a wife.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.950
In that case, I will not allow her
to remain in the Three Judicial Offices.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.399
I understand.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.039
You had better truly understand.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:35.960
Do not push Chu Chu
into the center of the storm yourself.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.000
Otherwise,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.519
when things collapse,
she will be the first to suffer.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.940
(Clear the Mind and Contemplate the Way)

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.080
Your Highness.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.039
Your Highness.

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.559
Did His Majesty agree?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.840
Yes.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.420
Your Highness.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.420
What did His Majesty say?

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:07.360
Wu Jiang.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.480
Summon Chen Er to conduct the autopsy.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.000
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.679
Chen Er has taken leave.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.290
I am confident that I can protect

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.500
the integrity of Master Shenguan's body
to the greatest extent.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.120
Let me do it.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.120
How can she touch our master?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.720
Is this not a clear insult to Nanzhao?

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:22.759
Exactly.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.360
If Chen Er is absent,
send for another coroner.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.799
Go at once.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.039
Yes.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.519
Your Highness.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.830
Attend to your other duties first.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.759
Say no more.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.039
In the Three Judicial Offices,
you follow my orders.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.000
We have solved so many cases together.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.440
I think

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.000
I am actually quite capable.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.240
Yet they still think I lack ability,

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.000
that the title of Imperial Coroner

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.900
belongs to
the Commandery Princess Consort An,

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:55.799
not to Chu Chu.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.679
I stand ready to obey.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.200
Your Highness.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.399
Think of how to praise Leng Yue and me.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:45.720
My dear, please.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.390
What is the situation
at the Zhao residence?

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.320
How should I put it?

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.320
Absurd, yet with a hint of sense.

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:00.559
Reasonable on the surface,
but still faintly suspicious.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.639
Madam Zhao was evasive at first,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.480
but after a few words
from Leng Yue and me,

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:06.519
she confessed outright.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.720
Master Shenguan did indeed die

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:10.730
while conducting
a ritual at the Zhao Residence.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.279
Nothing else stands out so far,
except this potted plant.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:16.759
What is wrong with it?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.399
I cannot say for sure.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.799
It just seems to be growing too lushly,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.200
not like an ordinary plant.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.780
Send it to the evidence room
for examination.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.919
That is strange, Your Highness.

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:33.360
Usually,

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:34.960
when I ramble on like this,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.799
you would scold me
or at least glare at me.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.000
Why no reaction today?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.120
If you are idle,
I can assign you more work.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.799
I am not idle.

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:46.039
I am swamped.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.790
I will find someone
to look into the plant.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.200
Leng Yue.

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:57.080
Your Highness.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:58.320
What is wrong?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.559
Did you quarrel with Chu Chu?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.780
(Body Preparation Room)

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.380
(Body Preparation Room)

00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:57.200
Chu Chu.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.500
You were looking for me?

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.720
There is something
I need your help with.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.000
No need to be formal.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:05.920
Just say it.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.000
I want to ask you

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.160
to conduct the autopsy
on Master Shenguan,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.540
on behalf of the Three Judicial Offices.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.519
You want me

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.680
to conduct the autopsy
on Master Shenguan,

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.090
on behalf of the Three Judicial Offices?

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:21.960
But

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.359
I have never examined

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.519
a real body before.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.480
I will guide you

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:28.519
through every step.

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.160
I have seen you practice.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.920
As long as I explain it clearly,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.720
you can do it.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.200
I have just acknowledged you
as my mentor,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.790
and you trust me this much already?

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:40.400
You are close with my brother.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.759
Of course I trust you.

00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:44.039
Besides,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.119
you are Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:47.340
If you conduct the autopsy,

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.839
they will have far fewer objections.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.759
I have never met someone
so straightforward.

00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:56.119
Alright.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.440
I agree.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.980
I will be your hands.

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:01.240
Thank you.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.119
You are right.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.759
The Buddha saves all beings.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.599
A coroner examines death and injury
to bring the truth to light.

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:21.520
That is saving lives too.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.880
I will make preparations.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.519
Chu Chu.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.000
It is not that I doubt you.

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.240
But...

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:43.880
I understand.

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:46.519
This matter is serious.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.559
You are trying to protect me.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.160
But I am also a member
of the Three Judicial Offices.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.640
Precisely because you are a member,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.880
you need only answer
for the task I assign you.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.039
I am your superior.

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:01.480
It is my duty to bear

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:04.519
all criticism and blame directed
at the Three Judicial Offices.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:05.680
You speak,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.160
and I will act accordingly.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.640
Begin.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.359
Alright.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.440
First, examine the body surface.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.119
On the body surface,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.930
there are no obvious external injuries.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.500
Use the Yin-yang Pestle
to wipe and examine the mouth and nose.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.799
The mouth and nose are clean.

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.330
There are no signs of ingestion.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.880
However, the complexion
is slightly darkened,

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.150
and the lips are purplish.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.519
These are typical signs
of sudden cardiac failure.

00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:10.480
According to his disciples' statements,

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:12.359
the deceased had no illness in life.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.960
You Chen'an, prepare for dissection.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.640
Understood.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.960
You truly never give me
a moment's peace.

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:27.400
I believe that a joint autopsy conducted
by the Three Judicial Offices

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.260
and a representative
of the Nanzhao envoy group

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:30.960
would help ease the impact

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.750
of Master Shenguan's death
on both sides.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200
And who do you propose?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:36.160
Gao Luoqian
harbors resentment toward you.

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:38.000
If you choose one of his men,

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:40.079
it will only cause more trouble.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.359
I recommend You Chen'an.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.480
He is the chief envoy of Nanzhao.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.680
His rank surpasses Gao Luoqian's,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.359
so he will not be swayed by him.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.319
At present,

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.590
he also relies on the protection
of the Three Judicial Offices,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.279
making him the most suitable choice.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.240
Proceed as you suggest.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.039
I will take my leave.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.599
Jinyu.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.880
The times are dark and turbulent.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.960
Do not disappoint me.

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:15.759
May we begin?

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.039
Mm.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:19.759
Go ahead.

00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:22.279
First, make an incision at the throat.

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:23.839
At the throat?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.480
What is it?

00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:26.839
Is there a problem?

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.599
Not exactly.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.880
If we enter
through the left intercostal space,

00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:34.079
we can examine the heart directly.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.920
That would better preserve
the eminent monk's appearance.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480
It also accords
with Nanzhao Buddhist rites.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:44.839
Mm.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.660
(Three Judicial Offices)

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.510
The back shows signs of bluing.

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:02.599
Clear

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.880
postmortem blood pooling
is visible on the back.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.839
The cardiac vessels are congested
with marked swelling.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.119
All findings are consistent

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.690
with death caused by cardiac failure.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:13.720
No prior illness,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.559
yet sudden cardiac failure.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:18.680
The most likely causes

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.400
would be heavy drinking and overeating,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.759
or prolonged exhaustion and stress,

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:24.119
and similar harmful habits.

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:25.880
But monastic life

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.759
follows very strict rules.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.519
There is another possibility.

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.559
Nanzhao summers are extremely hot.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.599
Monks often bathe in cold water.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.160
With the heat at its peak now,

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.480
sudden changes in temperature,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.200
combined with Master Shenguan

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.839
being unaccustomed to a new place,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.880
and performing
multiple rituals each day,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.079
under constant strain,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.119
could easily trigger a heart condition.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.920
It was never a criminal case.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.759
If I had thought further,

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.370
perhaps an autopsy
would not have been needed,

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:02.000
and the master would not bear that scar.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.480
You are a coroner,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.559
not a prophet.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.400
You cannot foresee everything.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.960
Then this conclusion,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.559
how will His Highness
answer to Gao Luoqian,

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:12.799
especially now that you are involved?

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.170
Your Highness.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.200
Second Prince.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.580
His Majesty has issued an order.

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:18.640
Master Shenguan's remains

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.630
are to be examined jointly by
the Three Judicial Offices and Nanzhao.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.430
Nanzhao will be represented
by Second Prince.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.290
Both sides shall issue

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.590
a joint examination certificate
with no objections raised.

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.160
With His Majesty's decree,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.119
everything is now on firm ground.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.640
Gao Luoqian and the others

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.960
will no longer target you.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.100
You really are impressive.

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:37.160
You saw this coming.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.480
He has been chanting sutras here
for Master Shenguan

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:51.880
for six full hours.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.799
He is an orphan as well.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.799
Master Shenguan raised him
from childhood.

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.039
To him,

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:01.160
Master Shenguan was both his master

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:02.640
and his father.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.000
Young Master Jing Yuan,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.079
the examination is complete.

00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:21.880
You will soon be able
to take Master Shenguan home.

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.160
The rain is heavy now.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.890
You should return to the temple first.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.079
If you fall ill,

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:30.960
Master Shenguan would be saddened.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.750
Your Highness.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.720
Use this.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.240
Let him be.

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:46.119
This is a Buddhist custom.

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:47.880
After a senior monk passes,

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:50.079
sutras must be chanted
for forty-nine days

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.640
to help him reach the Western Pure Land.

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:57.680
Wu Jiang.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.799
From now on, deliver vegetarian meals
to him three times a day.

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:01.720
Yes.

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:21.920
Losing his only family,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.500
and then seeing the body examined,

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.000
Jing Yuan must be heartbroken.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.039
Those of the Buddhist order

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.910
are sensitive about boundaries
between men and women,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.660
so they may harbor
reservations about you.

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.200
Please do not take it to heart.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.799
Do not worry.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.630
I will do my best

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.390
to stitch Master Shenguan's
body properly.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:50.799
The case file

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.480
will be submitted together with yours.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.240
That should keep Gao Luoqian in check,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.119
and ease the pressure on His Highness.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.920
Thank you.

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:01.839
Too soon.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.100
There is one more thing.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.790
I almost forgot to give it to you.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.140
(Discern the Bigger Picture
from Small Hints)

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.039
This anatomical chart was truly a gift
from the King of Nanzhao?

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.599
Yes.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:27.720
Yet even the most experienced coroners
would find it hard to remember

00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:29.960
such details of the human body.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.759
Let alone

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:33.839
recording them
with such complete accuracy.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.599
What is it?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.200
Is something wrong?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.279
Nothing is wrong.

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:42.920
It is too accurate.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.279
After death,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.839
the skin, hair,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.920
organs, and muscles

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:49.400
change drastically

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.880
over time.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.519
Even though

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:53.920
low temperatures and dryness
can slow the process,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.279
within two days,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.079
the organs decay by more than half.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.400
There is no way such detail
could be reproduced.

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:01.920
Unless

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.359
the subject was not truly dead.

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:08.319
But...

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:09.119
Perhaps

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:11.279
it was simply

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:13.119
someone examined

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:14.559
at the moment of death.

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.000
When my father gave it to me,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.680
he said nothing of this.

00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:22.880
As you know,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.200
as a coroner,

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.960
I only grasp the basics.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:27.680
Had you not asked,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.740
I would never have realized
how precious this chart truly is.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.799
I thought I had

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.160
improved a great deal,

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.500
yet I keep realizing
there is always someone better.

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:38.079
Just this single chart

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:40.200
already leaves me far behind.

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:42.470
Even so, you are
one of the finest coroners

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:44.359
I have ever seen.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.160
I had always been curious.

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:50.000
You were so young,

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.440
and you only became a coroner

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.880
after entering
the Three Judicial Offices.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.079
When Commandery Prince An
brought you into

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.090
the Three Judicial Offices
despite all opposition,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.319
it must have been

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.319
because of your diligence and talent.

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:01.400
Not exactly.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.519
The Three Judicial Offices

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:05.100
only appoint coroners

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.990
who are capable
of bearing the responsibility.

00:28:07.079 --> 00:28:08.440
How much I wanted this post,

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.720
or how hard I worked for it,

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:13.319
has nothing to do
with whether I am qualified.

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:15.839
His Highness protects me

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.759
because I serve under him.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.000
And anyone who serves under him

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:21.160
receives the same protection.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.079
That is why

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.039
if His Highness ever faces trouble,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.160
everyone under his command

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.920
would risk their life for him.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.160
Including me.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.319
What are you doing?

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:46.440
Chu Chu,

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.600
there is something about
my experience as a coroner

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:52.440
that I have kept from you.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.599
This is...

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:09.720
Judging by the direction of the scars
and the force used,

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.680
it looks like
they were caused by a whip.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.880
But an ordinary whip

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.640
would not leave scars this wide.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.039
Have you ever kept a cat?

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:23.599
A cat?

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.079
I did, back when I was in Qianzhou.

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:29.519
Then you should know

00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:31.559
a cat's tongue

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.519
is covered in tiny barbs.

00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:34.759
That whip

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.680
was much the same.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.440
Where it struck,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.559
it tore away flesh along with blood.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.759
Before it was used on me,

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:46.960
the whip was soaked in herbal decoctions

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.119
to prevent the wounds from festering.

00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:51.799
Of course,

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:54.640
it also made the pain unbearable.

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:57.720
I did not tell you the truth before

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.839
about how I gained
my experience as a coroner.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.160
It all came from what I endured myself.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.200
Endured myself?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.359
I grew up near
the border hunting grounds.

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:12.000
When there was no food,

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:14.319
I fought military hounds for scraps.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.599
If the guards caught me,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.359
a beating was inevitable.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.960
That was how

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.960
I survived among beasts.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.400
Stealing food again?

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.519
Stealing again?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.599
Stealing again?

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.319
That is worse than animals.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.790
The Commandery Princess
Consort An is fierce.

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:33.880
That is rare indeed.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.039
After you became Second Prince,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.960
were they terrified?

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:41.519
That title of mine

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:43.440
exists in name only.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.100
(Three Judicial Offices)

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:01.960
Your Highness.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.390
Before leaving, Mr. Chu
prepared some hometown dishes for you.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.990
He also warmed ginger soup
to ward off the cold.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.400
Where is His Highness?

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:12.799
His Highness...

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:14.519
His Highness sent word

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.279
for me to escort you home.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.100
Earlier, His Highness
said he wished to walk alone

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.240
and told us to take you back.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.759
He came by the autopsy room just now?

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:25.119
He did.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.079
He waited outside
for a while, then left.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.400
Let us go.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.270
Back to the mansion.

Because I serve under him.

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.640
And anyone who serves under him

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:20.799
receives the same protection.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.519
That is why

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.200
if His Highness ever faces trouble,

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.079
everyone under his command

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:27.000

Including me.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.960
What have I done to deserve

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.359
such faith from you?

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.519
I have given nothing in return,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.720
yet I keep bringing you trouble.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.599
Becoming a coroner
is your life's pursuit.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.240
I will never allow anyone

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.480
to destroy your ambition.

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:55.480
Not even His Majesty,

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.599
nor myself.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.400
He?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.599
Chu.

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.920
It's so late. Where have you been?

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:08.679
I brought you something nice.

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:10.480
What is it?

00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:13.800
Lotus seeds?

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.639
Where did you get these?

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.119
East of the West Market,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.199
there's a pond.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.559
I picked them fresh for you.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.880
I was wondering
whether lotus seeds in Chang'an

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.290
taste better than those in Qianzhou.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.320
They're good.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.559
I knew you'd like them.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.890
You've loved these
since you were little.

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:30.119
Chu,

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.190
why are you still up so late,

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:34.039
standing around here?

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:36.920
I…

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.400
I ate too much
and came out to walk it off.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.239
Where is His Highness?

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.920
He's staying at
the Three Judicial Offices for work.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.079
Did you argue?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.400
I've heard about what happened lately.

00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:51.599
That Xiao Jinyu

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.079
put you in an awkward spot in public,

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.290
then stayed out all night,
leaving you cold.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.800
Our family may not be wealthy,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.880
but I won't let you suffer like this.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960
His Highness did that

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:03.719
to spare me unnecessary

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.760
rumors and pressure.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.239
Over the years,
he has offended many people

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.360
by pushing legal reforms.

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:13.400
Now, because of Master Shenguan,

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.159
the Nanzhao envoys are pressing him.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.559
He doesn't want me dragged into this,

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:19.000
so he thought it best

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:21.039
that I stay away
from Master Shenguan's case.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.400
Truth is, I understand his intentions.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.960
It just feels a little unfair.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.660
I'm upset that he
doesn't trust me enough.

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.199
And I can't help wondering

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.079
if I were just a bit more capable,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.440
maybe I could shoulder more for him.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.079
You've already thought it
through so clearly.

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:41.320
Why not talk to him openly?

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.079
That makes sense in theory,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.920
but some things
he has to realize himself.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.780
So the real point
is the second part, right?

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.620
♪Time drips away

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.140
