Tan Jianfei!

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.819
I called you, but you didn't answer.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.218
Good thing I rushed over.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.980
Your fever's hit forty degrees.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.099
I'm not dying.

A bad woman like me

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.300
has a tough life.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.180
Don't talk about yourself like that.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.659
The videotape...

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.859
Can we still find a backup?

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.060
Tan Jianfei...

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.020
You were dreaming last night,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.340
calling his name over and over.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.500
That won't happen again.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.294
Throw it away.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.939
Do we really have to go this far?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.139
When I was twelve,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.939
he taught me how to mix pigments.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.580
He said

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.099
black has to be mixed with blood

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.099
to achieve the purest darkness.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.979
You forced my hand.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.938
The legendary Vice Chairman Zhao
has actually returned from overseas.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.960
Watch what you point at.
Do you want to lose your job?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.939
Where is Li Shujing?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.340
She seems to be in the design studio.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.380
Seems?

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:33.140
If I hear the word "seems" again,

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.072
you won't need to come back.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.380
I hear the company's
hired a new designer.

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.619
Quite something, apparently.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.780
Stirring the whole place into chaos.

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.139
I've long heard
that the Vice Chairman Zhao

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.880
who oversees
overseas operations is well-known.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.900
So young, yet already so high up.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.020
I'm nothing compared to that.

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:03.299
Compared to me,

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.140
you're simply not worthy.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.179
As for our team,

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.780
there's no room for random nobodies.

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.538
You'd better learn

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.739
how to be an obedient tailor.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940
Understand?

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.539
And if I don't?

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.499
Simple.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.220
Then I'll make you understand.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:33.819
(Mijing Club)

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.098
So the famous Young Chairman Tan

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.978
is sneaking drinks here,

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.419
honey whiskey, of all things.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.178
That sweet of a taste

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:42.619
doesn't look like the pastime

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.899
of someone who just got slapped.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.739
Didn't you keep an eye
on your little lapdog,

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:47.840
so you came to watch me
make a fool of myself?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.099
You look like you've
got plenty of time too.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.899
Too bad that lapdog

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.099
has nothing on his mind
but those pieces of evidence.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.059
It's three in the morning
and he's still replaying surveillance footage.

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.820
All he ever thinks about
is helping Li Shujing dig up proof.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:03.580
How boring.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.670
Isn't Li Shujing his sister?

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.619
Didn't expect Young Chairman Tan
to be this naive.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.340
They're not even related by blood.

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:16.338
Between a man and a woman,

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.260
there's no such thing
as pure friendship.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.139
Shujing.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.099
Stay away from me.

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.059
You think Zhao Rou
is only here for power?

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.658
She's far more dangerous than that.

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:38.619
So what?

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:41.140
You want me to kneel
and beg for your help?

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.059
Shujing, can you calm down for a second?

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.259
Who was it that casually burned

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.940
the evidence I worked so hard to get?

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.419
And now you're pretending to care?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.340
If you can't make her
leave the Tan Group right now,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.178
then stop acting concerned
in front of me.

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:57.700
So all this time,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.099
I was just a tool for your revenge
against the Tan Group?

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:02.499
A tool?

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.140
I've always relied on myself.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.900
But then I trusted you.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.580
What did I get in return?

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.139
You turned eight years of my effort

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.979
into a complete joke.

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:19.178
Shujing.

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:20.580
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.340
Get out.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.460
You...

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.659
I said get out, right now.
Did you hear me?

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.260
Let's go, Yusheng.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.419
The fabric shipment is settled.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:45.218
Based on the people you remembered,

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.579
those tied to Wang Jinkai
and Zhao Youcai,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.658
along with the names in our new ledger,

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:50.900
none of them refused.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.619
I knew it.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.499
The Tan Group is rotten
from top to bottom.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.820
Even if they all went to hell,

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.220
very few would be innocent.

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.020
Without securing the videotape
Wang Jinkai left behind,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.499
we're still missing a critical piece.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.780
For now, all we can prove

00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:11.255
is that they're all involved.

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.580
But to uncover the truth
about Uncle Li back then,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.820
we'll need another approach.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.859
They were all working
for Tan Zheng'en anyway.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.899
Dragging them down together

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.099
is already enough.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.739
As for what happened to Dad back then,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.819
I think I need to go back

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.419
to where it all began and investigate.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.819
You mean

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.340
you're going to the factory yourself?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.659
That's too dangerous.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.940
No matter how dangerous that place is,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.899
I'm going in.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.499
Then promise me,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.139
if anything comes up,
tell me right away.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.619
Relax, you little boy.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.220
