WEBVTT

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.950
You look perfect, Hiro.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.163
Shall we get out once the actress
ahead of us is past the main photo line?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.544
Who is that?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.671
Don't you know her?

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.922
That's Do Ra-mi.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.675
The one who's blowing up globally.
Do Ra-mi!

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.094
No, I don't know her.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.263
You really don't?

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.016
You haven't seen the Do Ra-mi movie?

00:00:58.683 --> 00:00:59.809
He has.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.980
It was in your Netflix viewing history,
both this month and last.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.691
Right, that killer zombie?

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.318
What was the actress's name again?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.861
Cha Mu-hee. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:14.783
Her name was in your search history,
yet you don't remember?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.536
Why do you even have my tablet?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.830
You said to always stand by
with it in hand.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.624
Don't snoop without permission.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.084
- Mirror.
- Here.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:30.799
Okay.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.180
What's up with her?

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.976
Why's she standing there like a zombie?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.561
You're right, she is.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.481
She's been standing there long enough.
What is she doing?

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.483
She should go so you can have your moment.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.193
Something seems off with her.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.987
She doesn't look well.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.157
If she faints, this red-carpet event
will come to a screeching halt.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.784
What?

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.619
But I waited three months.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.956
I waited three months
for this custom-made suit from Italy.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.459
I can't let that happen.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.879
- Hiro!
- Hiro!

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.715
No way. Is he going to walk past her?

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.802
He wouldn't do something so insane,

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.429
even if he wants to show off
that custom-made suit.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:22.934
Hiro is attending
the Tokyo International Film Festival

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:24.477
for the second year in a row.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:29.399
This year, his performance as Hideo
in Can I Love You? earned him acclaim.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.530
Wake up.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:38.449
I'll help you.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.290
Let's walk together.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:03.016
These two have been in touch to say
they just can't make the schedule work.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.603
{\an8}These three are definitely interested,

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.190
{\an8}but they said they couldn't decide yet
and asked for more time.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:13.234
As for these two,
they're very keen to join the show,

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.486
but I don't think Hiro will approve.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.907
Man, casting this show is such a pain.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:24.287
We need to confirm
the female cast member within the week.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.915
How about Cha Mu-hee?

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:28.541
Cha Mu-hee?

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.126
You mean Do Ra-mi?

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.253
Do Ra-mi's a zombie.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.466
Our show's called Romantic Trip.
Would a zombie really be a good fit?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.468
I think they might make a good match.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.929
This was just taken at the film festival.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.514
Take a look. People are going wild.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.229
Hasn't the Do Ra-mi craze died down?

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.524
I heard the drama she was set to star in
at her peak got canceled.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.168
I don't hate this.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.420
I love it!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.338
Seriously?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.466
- Check her availability with her agency.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.467
On it.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.054
Japan's ultimate romantic prince

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.349
meets Korea's horror queen.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.850
Nice to meet you.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.730
Howdy.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.819
Their personas are polar opposites.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.571
They are, which is why
communication would be key.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.032
That's the theme of our show.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.827
Two people
with different cultures and languages

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.289
rubbing off on each other while traveling.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.292
A meeting of black and pink.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:53.751
Blackpink?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.671
Our show should make it big like them!

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:58.715
Blackpink!

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:26.367
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:36.502
The doctor will be arriving shortly.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.212
Great, thank you.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:46.721
You won't get sleeping pills or sedatives
this late at night without a prescription.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.850
Fortunately, a psychiatrist I know
is willing to see you,

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.018
so see him first.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.563
I just need some medication.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.067
There's an important event
I need to attend.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.068
Tell the doctor.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:04.697
By the way,
how did you know I was at that hotel?

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.950
I'm staying at that hotel too.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.497
Yong-u, my manager,
said he saw you in the lobby earlier.

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.248
I see.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.003
Any symptoms other than anxiety?

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.382
What, do you think I'm faking it?

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:27.053
I'm dizzy, shaking, nauseous, feverish,
and feel like I'm about to faint.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.848
Let's check for a fever.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.434
What are you doing?

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:37.063
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, this is a hospital.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:42.110
If I told the doctor what you just said,
you'd be hospitalized, event or not.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.612
- Don't mess around.
- Earlier, I really…

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:48.616
I really did feel that way earlier.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.369
Why else would I ask for help
from a guy who rejected…

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.295
Ho-jin, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.338
Not at all.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.924
Come in. This way.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.636
Let's go in.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:09.554
Here.

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:18.396
Just tell him I came in for a prescription

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:22.275
because my heart was racing
and I felt really anxious.

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:39.125
He's asking you to describe in detail
the symptoms of your anxiety.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.294
Does he have to know that?

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:42.920
He is a doctor.

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.427
I just want him to write a prescription
without asking for details.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.138
You're not buying painkillers
at a drugstore.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.599
I could buy pills at a drugstore myself.

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:55.892
Exactly.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:59.437
You came here because you're struggling.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.981
Just tell him
what you're struggling with and how.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.157
He's a doctor,
so he'll keep this confidential, right?

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:16.537
Since you're interpreting for me,

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.290
you'd hear exactly
what's going on with me.

00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:21.834
I'd need to hear to interpret, yes.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.216
Otherwise, you should fly back to Korea.

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:30.218
You could catch a red-eye.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.179
No! I told you, I have a big event.

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:36.349
World-class directors and actors
are waiting for me.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:37.850
So is that doctor.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.441
Then I'll just say it.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.071
The reason I'm anxious is…

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.450
To be honest, I recently started

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:56.953
seeing Do Ra-mi.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.419
She just appears out of the blue.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.384
And she laughs…

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.888
as if she's mocking me.

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:31.445
At first, I thought I was seeing things
due to the fatigue.

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:34.615
But that wasn't it.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.119
Because I kept seeing her.

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:43.082
I hear Director Peter Jason
will be at the festival after-party.

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:44.083
Awesome, right?

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.003
And there'll be tons of famous actors.

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.338
Would it be rude to ask for a selfie?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.008
I know she's not real,
so I'd like to shake her off,

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:56.095
but I can't because I see her so clearly.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.975
I'm constantly on edge,
scared she'll suddenly appear.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.936
And today,

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.981
I think I just fell apart.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.948
Am I crazy?

00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:41.015
What drink do you want?

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.601
Whatever.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.983
I was in another serious accident

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.944
when I was about seven…

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.490
but I have no memory of it.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.868
My parents died in that accident,

00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:03.454
but I don't remember a thing.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:09.210
Is there any history of mental illness
in your family?

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:12.213
I grew up in my uncle's home…

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.802
and no one on my father's side
suffered from mental health issues.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.012
As for my mother's side…

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.602
I was told the accident
was my mom's fault.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.607
So no one ever told me anything about her.

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.068
I wouldn't know about her side.

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:51.627
As you can see,
Mu-hee is in pretty bad shape.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.755
After graduating from high school,

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.217
she wrote a note cutting ties
with her dad's side of the family.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.429
Whether she lives or dies,
please don't contact us.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.347
Pardon?

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.435
How heartless.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.990
Sedatives are just a quick fix.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.826
As soon as you get back to Korea,
get checked out properly.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.828
I can take care of myself.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.288
That's not from me.

00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.915
I'm just relaying
what the doctor said earlier.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:35.129
According to him, your condition
may not be stress-related but…

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.300
brain damage as a result of your accident.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:43.345
I understood everything,
thanks to you, so you can stop now.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.727
Your manager called me.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:52.438
I told him to come here.
He'll be arriving soon.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.231
You told Yong-u?

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:57.610
He said he was looking for you,
and I told him you were with me.

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:00.529
You told him we're here?

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.656
I said we came to see a doctor

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.744
because you had a sudden stomachache
and came to me for help.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.162
Right.

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.539
So you said I had a stomachache.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.505
It's just funny.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.926
I never told him, but Yong-u figured out
that I had made my move and got rejected.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.512
He must think I'm pathetic,

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:29.225
seeking out the guy who rejected me,
whining about a stomachache.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.436
He'll probably think I'm so thirsty.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.943
Maybe the meds are hitting.
I can't stop laughing.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.083
What's wrong with me?
I really must be mad.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.561
Thanks for your help today, Mr. Joo.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.189
But I don't think I can repay you.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.985
Because I never want to see you again.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.115
All you did was interpret my words…

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.785
but you've heard too much about me.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.626
So I don't even know what face to make
when I look at you.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.505
Today, I just laughed…

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.177
but I might cry when we meet again.

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:56.645
You should go before Yong-u gets here.
Thank you so much, and sorry about today.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.152
The doctor said you should rest,

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.487
but I'm guessing
you'll go to that big event.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.115
Of course.
I told you, this is my festival.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:13.245
I really love my life right now.

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.956
I never, ever want to stop.

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.003
Sure, enjoy the festival,

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.923
but please don't drink
since you've taken a sedative.

00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:26.216
Did the doctor say that too?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.635
I wasn't interpreting.

00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:30.137
They're my own words of concern.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:26.568
- I'm a big fan. Can we take a picture?
- Okay.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.886
Maybe it's because of the meds.

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.266
I'm so sleepy.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:11.697
It's the zombie.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.784
Hello.

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:19.997
So we meet again.

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:22.916
So you're Japanese.

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.503
He's pretty handsome.

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:28.338
Is he an actor?

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.717
What's she saying?

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:44.021
Why does he keep looking at me?

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.149
Does he have something to say?

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.321
What's with this woman?

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.573
Aren't you going to thank me at all?

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:56.533
A simple "thank you" isn't that hard.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.096
Okay, one, two, three, "V!"

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:19.264
Now, hearts?

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.434
- Here, one, two, three. Hearts!
- Hearts?

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.395
Thank you very much.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:35.322
Does she think she did me a favor
by taking a selfie with me?

00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.451
That zombie doesn't realize who I am.

00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:45.791
He seems very familiar.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.919
Perhaps he was in a movie I've seen?

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.724
Oh, thank you!

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:05.978
Please take this!

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.276
Please take this!

00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:15.195
I read the project proposal you sent,

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:18.157
but I have minimal experience with TV.

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.242
I'm not sure I'd be a good fit.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.869
Don't you worry.

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:25.080
That doesn't matter at all.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:29.293
We'll be traveling to several countries
in Europe and North America for our show.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:31.837
When we heard someone actually existed

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.631
who knew the languages
of every country we were visiting,

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.551
we thought, "We've found our savior!"

00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:40.220
Please help us out, just this once.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.806
How long is the filming period?

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:47.269
The overseas shoots will be a bit long.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:50.189
In total, about three to four months?

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.234
Right, that's pretty long.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.486
We'll be hopping from country to country.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.489
But we'll come back to Korea a few times
in between filming. Right, Ms. Cho?

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:01.742
Of course.

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.535
And the show's called Romantic Trip,

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:06.788
so we're only going
to magical, scenic places.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.625
- Wow, sounds wonderful.
- Jaw-dropping sites.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.627
Nothing rough or strenuous at all.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.503
- Right, Director Kim?
- Of course.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.715
Did you watch the last season in Korea
that aired last year?

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:18.884
You'd get the gist if you had.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:23.138
I worked with Producer Shin Ji-sun,
who introduced you to us, on that season.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:27.100
Ms. Shin Ji-sun introduced me to you?

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.060
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:33.482
Speaking of, Ms. Shin said
she would drop by to see you, Mr. Joo.

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.195
Oh, hey.

00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:39.321
Where's Ho-jin?

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.782
He left for a prior engagement.

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:42.950
He did?

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.078
- I thought we'd have lunch together.
- Yeah.

00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.873
I was hoping to butter him up over lunch,
but he wouldn't take the bait.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:53.460
Ms. Shin, didn't you say
you're dating his older brother?

00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:56.672
Tell him to put in a good word for us.

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:58.507
We're desperate.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:02.135
Well, my boyfriend
doesn't listen to me either.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.512
But I'll try talking to him.

00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:24.992
Look. Isn't that Na Jin-suk, the writer?

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.829
He came for a book signing, remember?

00:21:28.912 --> 00:21:30.497
You're right. It is Na Jin-suk.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.542
Still a flashy dresser, I see.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.463
Hey. I was going to…

00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:45.137
So you won't do the job?

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.349
I don't need to take a job in TV
when I already have plenty of projects.

00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.019
All right, then don't.

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:55.480
From what I heard, you'd have to be
out of the country for a good while.

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.357
Then you'd miss our wedding.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:01.528
Wedding?

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.574
We're getting married next month.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.117
I've made up my mind.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.994
I'm going to tell Ji-sun too.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:13.665
So you went ahead and decided that alone?
And it's as soon as next month?

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:17.878
She's wanted to get married all along.
I'm the one who's been holding out.

00:22:17.961 --> 00:22:20.297
It's been a constant argument between us.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.468
I'm so sick of arguing now,
and I've made up my mind.

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.679
So marriage it is.
Not gonna congratulate me?

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:32.476
Seems premature to congratulate you
when she doesn't even know it's happening.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.728
Come on, congratulate me.

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:38.398
Please? You're the only sane,
sensible one in our family.

00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:43.487
You're the only family I'm not embarrassed
to introduce to Ji-sun.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.280
Please help your big bro out.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.660
I'm somewhat embarrassed by you. How…

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.207
Where did you even get that tablecloth?

00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.086
Doesn't it look nice?

00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:02.714
No, it doesn't go
with the rest of your outfit at all.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.217
Wait, it doesn't?

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.719
- You try it on, then.
- No, I'm good.

00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:10.847
And I want the robot vacuum
you took from my place back.

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:14.976
No, not him! We've already bonded.
I've even given him a name, Alberto.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.561
What are you talking about?

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:20.357
If I say "socks,"
he even fetches my socks, you know.

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:25.570
- You okay? Do you need a cab?
- No, I'm good. She said she'd pick me up.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:27.864
Look. She's here already.

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.203
Hey.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:34.913
You, hush!

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.793
You're a real hassle, you know.
Ever heard of cabs?

00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:43.130
- Ho-jin, it's been a while.
- Thanks for coming.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.381
What's this?

00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:48.385
A flower.

00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:52.013
What, so you're the only one
who's drunk again?

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:55.767
As usual, you're the only one
having fun, aren't you?

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:58.103
No, I'm here today as per your command.

00:23:58.186 --> 00:23:59.813
You wanted me to pressure him.

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:02.649
Really? Well, did it work?

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:06.319
Jeong-su was really hoping
you'd sign on to his show.

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:09.156
No, he says he doesn't want to.
He has no reason to.

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:10.240
Hey, take this.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.534
- See you!
- Come on.

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:14.327
Hey, take this back!

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.663
Man, that looks great on you.
You're the best.

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:19.708
- It doesn't look--
- Give it to me. It's mine.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:23.545
He gave it to me for my birthday,
but he likes it so much that he wears it.

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:25.297
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:27.966
Why would you be sorry?

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.635
It's his fault for being inconsiderate.

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:33.513
He probably doesn't even remember
giving it to me.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:41.188
If he's being inconsiderate,
get mad at him. Don't just laugh it off.

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:44.900
Jin-suk assumes

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.069
everything's fine
unless you tell him otherwise.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.448
He thinks everyone's happy
as long as he is.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.659
You're right.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.663
If I keep indulging him,
I'll eventually grow tired.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.338
Should I beat him?

00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:11.426
Can I whip your brother
a few times, like this?

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.513
Yes, beat some sense into him.

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:17.641
Na Jin-suk's dead meat today.

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.726
Would whipping him with that even hurt?

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.688
I shouldn't actually hurt him.

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.191
Do you really think I want to hurt him?

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.027
I just want to scare him
into treating me better.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:34.783
By the way, are you really not interested
in the show Jeong-su is producing?

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:38.537
Shooting starts next month,
so he seemed pretty desperate.

00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:42.290
We're getting married next month.
I've made up my mind.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.711
Please reconsider.
Try to see it in a more positive light.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.839
All right, I will.

00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:51.341
Really?

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.010
I think I now have a reason

00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.513
to accept the job.

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:11.778
Hey, Mr. Joo!

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:16.366
Good night!

00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:18.410
- See you. Be careful!
- My little brother!

00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:19.619
Good night!

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:38.263
We're so happy to have you on board.
Thank you so much.

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.681
I should be thanking you.

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:45.687
We were so worried that you'd say no
because of the long international shoots.

00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:50.567
Going by the schedule you sent,
will we be in Canada next month?

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.611
Yes. Why?

00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:56.364
Would you need to come back to Korea
partway through?

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:59.367
No, I'd prefer to be overseas and busy.

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:02.120
Thanks so much for signing on!

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:03.622
Our savior!

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:07.667
It looks like she's here.

00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:11.630
Our female cast member is here
to do a preliminary interview.

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:14.924
Since you'll be interpreting for her,
why not come say hello?

00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:16.968
Has the cast member been finalized?

00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:19.137
There were several names
on the list you sent.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.472
It isn't any of them.

00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:23.016
We found someone new last minute.
She's an actress.

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:25.560
Have you seen the movie The Quiet Woman?

00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:28.355
Most people don't know the movie's title.

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:29.272
Is that right?

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:30.398
Do Ra-mi.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.900
You know Do Ra-mi, don't you?

00:27:33.234 --> 00:27:34.444
Do Ra-mi, as in--

00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:36.112
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is here.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:27:47.123 --> 00:27:48.500
Welcome!

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.383
This is Mr. Joo Ho-jin, the interpreter
who will be working on our show.

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:58.426
Mr. Joo, you know Cha Mu-hee, right?

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:00.053
Right, yes.

00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:03.682
Mr. Joo!

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.309
Do you know each other?

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:10.063
He was the interpreter for an interview
she did with a foreign magazine.

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.857
Really? That's great.

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.859
You'll be traveling together for a while,

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:17.862
so if you already know each other,
this will be a breeze!

00:28:18.446 --> 00:28:19.364
Small world!

00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:25.078
I had no idea
I'd run into you again here, Mr. Joo.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:30.375
I didn't think I'd be working
with you again either, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:40.844
You made it seem like
you'd never work in TV, yet here you are.

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:43.680
Are you doing better now?

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.682
Did you see a doctor?

00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:50.520
Please don't bring that up here.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.357
Let's talk about this later
in private, Mr. Joo.

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.318
Ms. Cha Mu-hee,
we're about to start the interview.

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:58.319
Okay.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:06.244
Ms. Cho, the writer, will ask you
about five or six questions.

00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:07.162
Got it.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.788
Okay, let's get ready.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.464
Mu-hee.

00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:22.427
Just speak naturally and comfortably,
like you're talking to a friend.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.722
Look into the camera.
I'll be asking you the questions.

00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:27.223
All right.

00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.481
Let's get started.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:39.527
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, do you like to travel?

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.489
Yes, I do.

00:29:43.072 --> 00:29:45.950
But I haven't had
many opportunities to travel.

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:50.038
Still, I like visiting new places.

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:57.170
Shush!

00:30:01.341 --> 00:30:03.927
Sorry, Mu-hee.
Let's start again from the top.

00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:07.722
Do you like to travel?

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.185
Travel?

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.898
Travel… travel, yes.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.151
But I haven't had many chances to travel.

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:46.135
Mu-hee.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.180
Mu-hee!

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.103
I'm sorry.

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.605
Please keep your eyes on the camera.

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:00.316
And relax your hands a bit.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.820
I'm sorry. My apologies.

00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:07.115
Sorry, I'll start again.

00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:18.793
I'm sorry.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:21.504
Sorry, let me do that again.

00:31:22.338 --> 00:31:25.008
I haven't had many chances to travel, but…

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:26.926
But…

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.478
Let me do that again.

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.113
My apologies.

00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:51.659
Let's take a break.

00:31:52.368 --> 00:31:53.536
She's awful.

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:57.206
She's not well-spoken, not funny,
and can't even focus.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.711
Maybe it was just Do Ra-mi, the character.
The actress herself has no charm.

00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:06.674
She did okay
when she appeared on Junprecedented.

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:10.428
Well, there you have
Jun Hyun-moo as the host.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.389
Let's end the shoot.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.352
Let's rethink the female cast member.
I'm not so sure about Cha Mu-hee.

00:32:17.852 --> 00:32:20.355
I thought you said we'd make it big.
Like Blackpink big!

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.023
I don't think we will!

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:25.068
How do I send her packing?

00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:28.071
She probably came in
believing this was a done deal.

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:45.380
I screwed up the shoot, didn't I?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.423
Ms. Cho did not look happy.

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:50.093
You were just nervous
about doing something new.

00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:52.845
It'll get easier once you get used to it.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.476
By the way, Mu-hee,

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:02.814
did you really not know
Mr. Joo was working on this show?

00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.525
Didn't you see how shocked I was?

00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.485
I'm not that good an actress.

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.155
What's he even doing here anyway?

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.368
I actually asked
the assistant director in passing.

00:33:15.868 --> 00:33:17.996
He only signed on
as a favor to Producer Shin.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.455
Producer Shin Ji-sun?

00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:22.583
The woman we found
by digging through his Instagram.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.668
Yeah, I know.

00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:28.506
So he's here because of her.

00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:31.592
She was the coproducer
of the Korean season of Romantic Trip.

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:36.389
I hear he adamantly refused at first,
but she talked him into it.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.726
It seems he still likes her a lot.

00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:42.645
Okay, I got it. Stop it.

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:44.522
What's wrong with you?

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:54.615
Let's finish
the rest of our conversation here.

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.034
Did you see a doctor?

00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:57.618
I can take care of myself.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:01.414
You made it seem like
you weren't into TV gigs.

00:34:01.956 --> 00:34:03.166
I guess that wasn't true.

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:05.209
Did your doctor say you can take this on?

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:09.464
You'd be out of the country for a while.
That won't be a problem?

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:12.675
That's not a problem…
as long as I'm okay with it.

00:34:13.509 --> 00:34:16.179
What about you?
Will you be okay working with me?

00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.638
Don't try to change the topic.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.099
Have you seen a doctor?

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.102
Seeing me again bothers you, right?

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:24.771
I feel the same.

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:27.398
Can't you just drop out of this project?

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:31.819
I don't enjoy feeling uncomfortable.

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:35.239
You pulled me in as an interpreter,

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.658
and I heard things I wish I hadn't.

00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:40.703
It bothers me, so just give me an answer.

00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:42.121
Then I'll drop out.

00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:48.169
I…

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:51.756
did see a doctor.

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.975
Did the accident

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:05.103
somehow damage my brain?

00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:08.231
According to the MRI,

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.526
there's nothing wrong with your brain,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.030
However, if you are indeed suffering
from hallucinations,

00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:20.952
something must be damaged
that modern medicine can't diagnose.

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.832
Then what's going to happen to me?

00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:31.754
You're not suffering from any paralysis
or memory issues, just hallucinations.

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:35.925
You should see a psychiatrist regularly.

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.761
I did, but they told me
to see a neurologist

00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:40.930
since it's likely accident-related.

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:45.226
I swear, I'm completely fine
except for occasionally seeing Do Ra-mi.

00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:47.770
Can't I just chase her away?

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:54.068
As we don't know why she's showing up
or why it's Do Ra-mi in particular,

00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:56.571
we have no way to chase her away.

00:35:58.614 --> 00:36:01.284
There's no way to chase Do Ra-mi away
with modern medicine.

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:04.662
I was so frustrated
that I even visited a shaman.

00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:07.665
But since she's not a ghost,
no ritual would work.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.334
Satisfied?

00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:12.587
Does that lessen your discomfort?

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.841
Now drop out like you promised.
End of conversation.

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.636
Me dropping out won't solve your problem.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:25.266
You were visibly shaken earlier.

00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:29.270
You seemed like
a completely different person today

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.105
from the last time on set.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:33.733
Well, I am. Do Ra-mi's in my head now.

00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:35.151
Can you keep going like this?

00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:38.738
So what? Will you tell the producer
so they drop me?

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:42.241
Go ahead. Tell them,
"She sees Do Ra-mi. She's crazy."

00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:43.743
Then I'd be dropped instantly.

00:36:43.826 --> 00:36:45.369
I don't have to do anything.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.122
That will happen regardless.

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:50.833
The director's note says,

00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:53.294
"The joy of travel,
the thrill of romance."

00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:58.216
Who would feel happy or thrilled
looking at your anxious, restless eyes?

00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:01.510
Just looking at you makes me feel uneasy.

00:37:03.846 --> 00:37:05.973
You've admitted to yourself
that you're crazy,

00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:08.768
yet you seem to have no desire
to grasp reality.

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:12.104
I guess I won't bother stopping you.

00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:16.317
Good luck, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:18.611
I'll drop out, as you wish.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.282
Thank you, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:26.535
But will you be okay?

00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:30.081
If you drop out now,
you'll disappoint the woman you like.

00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:34.543
Didn't you only take this job
to impress Producer Shin Ji-sun?

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:39.632
You said you'd keep it a secret forever,
but I guess you changed your mind.

00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:49.475
You must've already told her
and gotten a ton of credit for it.

00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:52.436
Dropping out now
would put you in a tough spot.

00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:56.440
Yes, it does put me in a tough spot.

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.693
Now I have no means of avoiding it.

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:02.196
She's getting married soon.

00:38:02.863 --> 00:38:03.823
To my brother.

00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:11.497
I wanted to avoid having to help out
and be stuck watching.

00:38:12.331 --> 00:38:14.041
So I found a way to do that…

00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:19.005
but I lost it
trying to avoid a crazy person.

00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:31.017
You idiot.

00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:42.069
Mr. Joo!

00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:46.115
Hey, are you and Ms. Cho close?

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:50.328
I think they're dropping Mu-hee
from the show.

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.330
They must've hated the interview.

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.041
They stopped the shoot
and aren't giving me the contract.

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:56.792
I have a bad feeling.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.045
Could you put in a good word?

00:38:59.628 --> 00:39:01.172
I'm telling them I'm dropping out.

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:02.757
That's it.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.551
Tell them if they drop Mu-hee,
you'll walk.

00:39:05.634 --> 00:39:07.511
They seem to really like you.

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.764
That's not why I'm dropping out.

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.933
Don't get me involved.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:15.770
Mr. Joo!

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:21.650
Please join us for a meal today.
We can discuss the show as we eat.

00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:23.944
- I have something to say.
- Let's talk over lunch.

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.697
We booked the Japanese place out front.
Do you drink?

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:28.324
We have the company card.

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.785
Let's all go. Let's go.

00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:33.954
If Mu-hee's out, so are you. Loyalty!

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:36.582
- I said keep me out of it.
- Come on.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.316
Get in. We should go together.

00:40:03.651 --> 00:40:04.693
Now you're talking to me?

00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.618
Fine.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.286
I'll go with you.

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.759
So you're finally acknowledging me.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.096
But it's a shame.

00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:35.558
You made a fool of yourself
in front of the guy you like.

00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:40.729
- You crazy bitch.
- Just shut up!

00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:43.274
I said shut up! Be quiet!

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:44.775
Go away!

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:47.111
Get away from me!

00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:30.321
Fucking hell.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.165
I scared you, didn't I?

00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:42.583
The truth is,

00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:45.961
something almost drove me mad,
so I let it.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.048
Ms. Cho.

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:51.717
You seem quite surprised.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.093
Sorry about that.

00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:56.889
You don't like me, do you?

00:41:57.848 --> 00:42:01.018
Earlier, you were looking at me
from behind the camera with a totally…

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:04.230
Director Kim!

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.565
You were debating, weren't you?

00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:07.983
"How do we drop her?"

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.362
Just straight up go for it.

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:14.448
Sure, I'll be bitter,
but it's not like I'd take revenge.

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.951
It's not like I really am Do Ra-mi.

00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:23.249
Mu-hee.

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.270
Yong-u.

00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:46.021
Let's go.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.301
Ho-jin.

00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:17.303
Can you help me for a minute?

00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:19.179
- Sure.
- I need an extra hand.

00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:23.726
Can you grab the book
on the top shelf over there?

00:43:24.226 --> 00:43:26.854
On the right. The one
that's the color of a leaf in fall.

00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:28.689
That's the one.

00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.281
What's this?

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.785
It's your family photo.

00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:46.040
The dad, mom, and son may all be living
in different countries now,

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.000
but you seem close here.

00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:50.169
Well, I was only in elementary school.

00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:53.464
- And the tall one here is Na Jin-suk?
- Yes.

00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:56.216
What's he doing in your family photo?

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:57.926
He's still Father's son.

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:01.889
My goodness.

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:05.476
I don't get your mom,
accepting her husband's illegitimate son,

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.145
or your dad, grinning happily beside her.

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.481
Or Na Jin-suk's eagerness to be included.

00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.192
Your family sure is a strange bunch.

00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:14.902
Want to know something even stranger?

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:17.279
This photo

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.615
was taken by Jin-suk's mother.

00:44:19.698 --> 00:44:20.658
What?

00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:25.120
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.415
Your family's so open-minded.
It's like you're American!

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.042
Unbelievable.

00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:33.379
Will the family be getting together again
for Jin-suk's wedding?

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.092
He called me and asked me to officiate.

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.510
He said it's next month.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.762
I played coy and said no.

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.181
You shouldn't have.

00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:45.599
I don't want to.

00:44:46.642 --> 00:44:50.312
I've already decided the first wedding
I'll officiate will be yours, Joo Ho-jin.

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:56.652
So… how are things going
with that actress?

00:44:57.653 --> 00:44:59.822
I'm telling you, nothing is going on.

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:03.117
You can't pull the wool
over this old man's eyes.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.911
Make an effort, and don't play coy.

00:45:05.994 --> 00:45:07.871
And speak to her a little more kindly.

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:12.793
Do I tend to speak unkindly?

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:18.382
You're downright mean and blunt
when you're saying the right thing.

00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:26.265
Do you know how many languages
there are in the world, Mr. Interpreter?

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.352
I believe over 7,100.

00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:32.855
Nope. Wrong answer.

00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:36.692
There are as many languages
as there are people.

00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:39.486
Everyone speaks their own language.

00:45:40.028 --> 00:45:44.408
That's why people misunderstand,
misinterpret, and offend each other.

00:45:47.202 --> 00:45:49.538
From what I've heard,
Joo Ho-jin's language

00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:53.250
is firm and neat,

00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:55.544
but sharp.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.800
Who would feel happy or thrilled
looking at your anxious, restless eyes?

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.845
Just looking at you makes me feel uneasy.

00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.308
If my words were sharp…

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.729
it must've hurt to hear them.

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.567
You're needed.

00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:21.487
A diner at the restaurant
asked to see you.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.863
Can you come now?

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.458
Please sit.

00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:38.587
Going to your place felt too stalker-ish,
so I asked you to meet me here.

00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.350
You saw me
wigging out that day, didn't you?

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:57.481
The production staff
hasn't been in touch since.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.567
I think I lost that gig.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.656
I spoke out of line that day.

00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:10.536
No. I'm the one
who went mad and crossed the line.

00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:15.249
I'm sorry.

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:18.585
I shouldn't have brought up
Producer Shin Ji-sun.

00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:23.090
I guess I wanted to
point out your weakness

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:26.552
since you knew mine.

00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:32.307
So how is it now? Your weakness?

00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:33.809
Do Ra-mi?

00:47:36.311 --> 00:47:39.189
Since I flipped out like that,
she's been quiet.

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:40.399
I don't see her.

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:46.613
I guess letting it out once in a while
is more effective than a sedative.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.244
Still, try not to explode like that
just anywhere.

00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:54.454
I should be more careful.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:00.002
What about your weakness?

00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:03.672
They set a date for the wedding.

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:07.551
I'm considering where to run away to
before I get roped into the wedding stuff.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:18.020
You should just work on that show
instead of looking for another gig.

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:23.525
Yong-u says they're still
frantically searching for an interpreter.

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:27.362
I know. They keep contacting me,
asking if I can join them.

00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:28.989
Really?

00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:30.782
Lucky you.

00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.284
I got canned.

00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:35.287
You sealed it with that meltdown,
and now you're bummed?

00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:36.872
Of course I am.

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.082
It was a really good opportunity.

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.126
For an image makeover.

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:45.839
After Do Ra-mi's success,
a lot of scripts came my way,

00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:49.384
but they were all about serial killers
with split personalities or butchers.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.472
If I played all those roles,
I'd have a four-figure kill count.

00:48:53.972 --> 00:48:55.182
So as lethal as a missile.

00:48:56.516 --> 00:48:59.019
I really wanted to shed that image,

00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:01.438
and the objective of that show

00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:04.107
was "The joy of travel,
the thrill of romance."

00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:08.820
And seeing the Northern Lights
was on the itinerary.

00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.032
I've always wanted to go see them.

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:15.869
Yeah, I've wanted to go there too.
It's a tough place to go alone.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.412
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:49:18.246 --> 00:49:20.040
Kinda tough to make it out there.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.962
It's just too bad.

00:49:38.266 --> 00:49:39.559
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:42.396
Yes, Yong-u?

00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:44.856
The Northern Lights…

00:49:49.444 --> 00:49:50.278
What?

00:49:54.282 --> 00:49:55.659
Yeah, okay.

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:00.580
Okay, I'll call you right back.

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:03.291
All right.

00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:17.347
Is it Yong-u?

00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:19.516
If something's come up, go.

00:50:20.642 --> 00:50:24.021
I just booked something huge.

00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:28.275
The production team of Romantic Trip

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:29.901
confirmed my casting.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:31.528
They sent a contract.

00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:34.489
That's…

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.994
That's great.
You were disappointed earlier.

00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:42.080
But

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:46.585
the thought of actually going
scares me a little.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:51.173
I hope you have
a happy, thrilling, festival-like trip.

00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:54.092
How will that be possible?

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.635
Look here.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:59.473
How can you be so flippant about this
when you know about Do Ra-mi?

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.019
Somewhere I don't speak the language
and no one knows what I'm going through.

00:51:04.102 --> 00:51:06.063
Do you think I'd be okay on my own?

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.106
Look here.

00:51:08.648 --> 00:51:10.984
I'm gracefully removing myself
from the situation

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.736
after giving you some encouragement.

00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:15.822
You wanted this.
Why provoke me to say words that cut?

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.699
Whether it cuts or stings, go ahead.

00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:20.077
This time,
I'll understand it as your concern.

00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:28.627
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:32.589
You're a very spontaneous
and capricious person.

00:51:33.215 --> 00:51:37.094
You say "A," argue that you said "B,"
then go back on your word and say "C."

00:51:38.178 --> 00:51:40.972
Add Do Ra-mi,
the source of your anxiety, to the mix,

00:51:42.474 --> 00:51:44.309
and you'll explode again like last time.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:45.644
No doubt about it.

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:53.568
You're right.

00:51:55.487 --> 00:51:56.488
Then…

00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.700
what if someone who knows everything

00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:05.205
and who can keep a cool head
and calm me down

00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:06.832
were there with me?

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:13.463
And if they're good with languages,
I should feel at ease overseas, right?

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.841
I think I could handle it

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:17.759
if someone like that were with me.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.177
What do you think?

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:20.262
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:22.973
Explain so I can understand.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:24.516
Your language,

00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:27.477
speaking in opposites to hide weakness
and lashing out when angry,

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.272
is too hard for me to interpret.

00:52:30.355 --> 00:52:31.189
So you're saying--

00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:32.524
Please help me!

00:52:33.441 --> 00:52:36.069
I'd like you to come with me.

00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:42.784
Do I make you uncomfortable?

00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:45.203
Are you scared
I'll threaten you into dating me?

00:52:45.287 --> 00:52:46.830
Threats wouldn't work on me.

00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:48.415
Then let's go together.

00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.835
If you go,
you'll get to see the Northern Lights.

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:54.838
The Northern Lights.

00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:59.843
The Northern Lights. Green and blue.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.845
You could take photos.

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:04.848
Once-in-a-lifetime photos…
The Northern Lights!

00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:15.942
Fine. I'll join you.

00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:19.154
I need somewhere to hide anyway,

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.908
and I also want to see
the Northern Lights.

00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:25.785
Great, let's go see
the Northern Lights together.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:54.689
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:20.043
