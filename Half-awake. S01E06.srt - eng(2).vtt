=Episode 6=

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.760
Sis,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.460
you don't recognize me anymore?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm Yinan.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.880
Yinan...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040
You're Qianyu's brother, Xiao Yinan.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.520
You've changed so much.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.800
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.240
After all these years,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.280
my sister and I have been
searching for you.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.680
She said she saw you a few days ago.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.460
But I've been busy
with tournaments lately,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.080
so I couldn't find time to meet you.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680
Didn't expect we'd run
into each other so soon.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.080
Xingwan,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.240
how have you been these years?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.880
You've really changed a lot.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.600
I barely recognized you.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280
And those things you just said to me...

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.160
You're testing me, aren't you?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.200
No. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.360
Everything I said just now is true.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.620
(Why such a coincidence?)

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.920
(Why does it happen to be Yinan?)

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.840
(No way.)

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.440
(I can't drag Yinan into this again.)

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.840
Are you hiding something from me?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.640
- You can tell me.
- Yinan.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.560
You're still young.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.800
Life out there is brutally competitive.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.960
Most of the time,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.920
things are beyond our control.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.920
What if I stick to my original attitude

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.040
and refuse?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840
Then I'll find another way.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.240
I'm leaving.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.800
What does it mean?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.600
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.820
That woman isn't as simple as she seems.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.760
Acquiring an e-sports club

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.520
doesn't require her to use her charm.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.900
She just told you she likes you,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990
then turned around and got involved
with another guy.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.840
She never changes.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.520
Do you think she will get involved

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.460
with a college student?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.040
I used to think so too,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.240
but...

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.040
You've never let any woman

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.520
move into your villa, have you?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.320
I was right, huh?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.040
Ever since she moved in,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.330
I haven't been back there once.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.560
I'm just reminding you:

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.400
you're the hunter,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.800
and don't end up
as someone else's prey.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.200
Letting her near our core business

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.460
is basically giving her a chance

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.880
to find our weak spots.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000
Don't forget why we're here.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.640
Yixiao.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.320
Yixiao.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.520
You head out first.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.760
What brings you here?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.080
I just got out of school

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.370
and came to have dinner with you.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.920
Senior Ivan?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.280
Why do you have a photo of him?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.400
Senior Ivan?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.600
Are you two close?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.080
Are you jealous?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.480
There's nothing between us.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.720
The E-sports Club was the first club
I joined

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.200
after entering Donghua University.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520
Ivan and I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.040
actually grew up together.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.280
You two grew up together?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.240
Still, it's not as close as with you.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.880
I know you treat me the best.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.760
What about your sister?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.120
She is also close to him?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.840
Of course she is.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.680
Speaking of that,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.040
Ivan's always been glued to my sister
since he was a kid.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.720
He was basically her little shadow.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.560
And she spoiled him a lot too.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.640
Why suddenly ask about this?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.200
Nothing.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.640
Let's grab something to eat later.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.880
Sure.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.920
(These)

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.440
(are just basic materials.)

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.280
(E-sports Club Acquisition Proposal)

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.360
(Looks like the core files)

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.680
(should be in his computer.)

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.440
(But there are so many cameras
in his house)

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.220
(and he placed the computer)

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.320
(right out in the open.)

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.960
(Maybe he's trying to test me
on purpose.)

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.200
(I have to think of a way.)

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.720
(Ye Xingwan,)

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.040
(you'll never have a real friend.)

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.080
(Everyone you care about)

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.780
(will be forced to stay away
from you.)

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.020
(Gu Group)

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.070
(How can I)

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.920
(crack Gu Yixiao's computer password?)

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.440
(Right!)

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.200
(Yinan's from the Department
of Computing.)

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.880
(Maybe I can ask him for help.)

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
Why do you look so tense?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920
What's on your mind?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.480
Obviously, I'm thinking about you.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.780
I've been waiting for you at home.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.680
But you never come back.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.800
If I don't go home,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.520
wouldn't it be more convenient for you

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.040
to do what you want?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.760
There are cameras all over the house.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.400
What can I do?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.240
Ye Xingwan,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.480
the club acquisition plan,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.560
why hasn't it started yet?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.160
Is it that you can't,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.480
don't dare to,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.400
or are afraid of implicating someone?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.680
I've been with you for so long.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.740
Everyone around me now works for you.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.160
There's no one else
I care about anymore.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.400
You lied to me again.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.920
You've been acting out lately.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.640
You always meet old friends.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.040
Seems like last time,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.240
the nightclub incident,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.840
didn't teach you a lesson.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.380
I'll give you one more chance.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.520
Since you say you don't care
about anyone,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.120
then prove it to me.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.480
Let go.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.440
Let go of me.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520
Let me go.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.380
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the police.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.280
Xingwan!

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.130
Mr. Gu,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.640
I don't know how this person got in.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.900
He insisted on meeting Miss Ye

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.000
and made a scene.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.960
It's my fault.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.780
I shouldn't have turned down
your proposal.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.200
Just come at me.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.680
Can you let my friends go?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.120
What do you mean?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.560
Their accounts

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.020
suddenly received funds from nowhere.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.780
The school says they misused the budget.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.440
They're facing disciplinary action.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.380
Are you trying to use this
to threaten me?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.200
Is this the way

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.440
the group conducts its business?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.600
I didn't...

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.840
Young man,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.040
we need solid proof before acting.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.990
The disciplinary action came
from your school.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.840
It has nothing to do with us.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.840
I overheard it
outside the Office of Academic Affairs.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.240
You were the ones behind it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.240
Miss Ye,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.720
this project

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.040
is your responsibility.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.520
You take care

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.960
of this matter.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.920
But let me give you a heads-up.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.840
Your attitude

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.440
will determine who will be responsible

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.280
for this project in the future.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.480
Yes,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.640
that's right.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.560
I did it.
