=Episode 8=

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.920
Who's there?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.320
What are you doing?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.520
The power's out.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.920
I came to find...

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.280
I came to find a candle.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.620
(Gu Yixiao)

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380
(Gu Yixiao)

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.080
You're scared.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.840
Of course I am.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.480
It's pitch dark.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.440
Who wouldn't be scared alone at home?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.600
You got a call a minute ago.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.990
Hello? This is Haicheng
Property Management.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.720
The power is out,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.720
so I called them.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160
Ye Xingwan,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.480
let me ask you one more time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.200
What are you doing in my study?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.240
I told you, I came here
to find a candle.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.040
I just left Haicheng

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.360
and the power went out.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.740
That can't just be a coincidence, right?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.040
This computer

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.560
allows three chances
to enter the wrong password.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.920
If you already tried just now,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.320
then the remaining tries

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.880
will be reduced accordingly.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.860
(Gu Yixiao)

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.220
(Gu Yixiao;
Use Touch ID or enter the password)

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.840
Dad's memorial day.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.800
This is Villa No. 1.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.320
I report the outage for repair.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
I called for repairs before you came in.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.760
It should be fixed by now.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.880
Now do you believe me?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.240
Ye Xingwan. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.520
Ye Xingwan.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.400
You came back in the middle
of a meeting.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.280
You were testing me, weren't you?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.840
I guess I misunderstood.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.520
Sorry about that.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.360
(He does know how to apologize.)

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.000
(Looks like Wang Yaqin really
understands him.)

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.480
It's almost midnight.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.520
Are you hungry?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.070
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440
Eat it while it's hot.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.840
Why this noodle?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.200
Isn't today your birthday?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.120
Happy birthday,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.640
Gu Yixiao.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.640
Coriander noodles?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.280
That's not common, right?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.080
He loves it?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.560
Yeah, he really does.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480
I can teach you.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.080
Give it a try.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840
If you like it,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.480
I'll make it for you often.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.040
Ye Xingwan,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.330
stop thinking you're clever.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.640
Don't waste time on these things.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.640
Happy birthday.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.000
If you like it,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.320
I'll make it for you often.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.640
Yixiao,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.320
you're one year older now.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.160
Longevity Noodles are here!

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.440
Here comes the noodles!

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.160
Xiao,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.260
you've got to have Longevity Noodles
on birthdays.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.000
Only in this way can you
grow up healthily

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.580
- and live a long and happy life.
- Yes.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.960
Live a long and happy life.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.800
(No,)

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.400
(I don't love her.)

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.320
(The one who caused my dad's death)

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.080
(must endure every hardship.)

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.720
Xingwan, you scared me to death
yesterday.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.960
I almost rushed over to find you.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.800
I'm sorry, Qianyu.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.920
It was too dangerous this time.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.440
I shouldn't have dragged you into it.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.040
We're best friends.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.980
We stick together
through thick and thin.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.440
Gu Yixiao is naturally suspicious

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.200
and ruthless.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.080
Qianyu, listen to me.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.760
Quit the nightclub quickly

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.680
and find another job instead.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.960
What about you?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.560
Will he treat you the same way?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.280
I can't leave just yet.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.520
But don't worry.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.000
I'll make sure I'm safe.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.320
On his birthday banquet,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.880
I'll give him another pair of cufflinks.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.960
In this way,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.360
he will gradually let down his guard.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.640
Hello? Xingyue.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.920
It's Yixiao's birthday today.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.720
Let me handle the gift for you.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960
OK.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800
(Ye Xingwan,)

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.880

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.160

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.800
