00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.010
Jiaqi, where did you disappear to?

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.780
Didn't we already stand up for you?

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.980
Why are you still sulking?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.260
I just stepped out to clear my head.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.410
If you're still upset,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.540
I can call that guy out.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.500
We'll deal with him one-on-one again.

Do you really think my bro is that kind of person?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.850

where you often camp with the Chairman?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.780
Camp? He just comes here to sit by the fire.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.100
I think it's pretty nice.

is completely hooked on sitting by the fire.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.060
And then he'll start talking

You promised me, didn't you?

You said you wouldn't come into my place again.

I knocked properly.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.250
You just wouldn't open the door.

When I was little, my favorite thing

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.340
was the Chinese walnut cookies you made.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.410
After you made them,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.980
you'd have her take them to school.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.780
Whenever we got hungry, we'd sneak a few.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.930
I've tried every Chinese walnut cookie

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.820
were arranged by Mr. Gu.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.980
Does he have proof?

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.610
The Inspection Office searched everything,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.340
but they didn't find anything.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.010
Su Gengsheng,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.130
as the head of the Inspection Office,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.180
never said a word to me about it.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.420
He's probably thinking Mr. Gu

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.490
is very likely to stay on,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.610
so he has his concerns.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.420
Finding someone I can truly trust

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.610
is harder than it sounds.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.730
- Chairman. - Chairman.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.060
You should've told me you were coming.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.130
I could've picked you up.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.130
You're all the pillars of this company,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.130
unlike me, who has nothing better to do.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.490
- Chairman. - Chairman.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.100
Chairman.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.890
Good day, Chairman.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.100
Hello.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.820
Have a seat.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:47.730
Chairman.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:49.940
Jiaqi,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.130
I'd like to have a chat with you.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:53.820
How about it?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.980
This weekend, the day after tomorrow,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.850
let's play a round of golf.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.460
I'm sorry, Chairman.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.980
I don't play golf.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.460
Then, what do you play?

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.890
Soccer.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.420
Soccer?

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.300
All right.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.940
If it's soccer,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.420
I could've played a match with you

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.700
50 years ago.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.610
Now,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.340
no chance.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.010
Not now, definitely not.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:21.890
Chairman.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.890
I found a great spot

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.940
on Baihua Mountain.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.940
I was thinking,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.300
this weekend I'll have the firewood

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.010
and the tent ready.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.940
Let's take a trip out there.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.220
Sure.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.940
The day after tomorrow's the weekend, isn't it?

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:32.890
Pick me up early.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.460
You got it.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.850
Jiaqi, what do you say?

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.700
Come along the day after tomorrow.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.420
Why does it smell like charcoal smoke?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.100
Had barbecue with coworkers.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.130
Sooner or later,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.490
we'll find something

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.700
we can do together.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.940
Chairman,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.770
if you'd like, I can let the doctor know

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.010
and take you out

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.850
for some fish ball soup tonight.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.770
No need.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.820
This weekend

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.580
is for you, the young people.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.460
I

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.890
know when to step aside.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.980
All right, you can all head back now.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.130
I'll see you out.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.060
Go on.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.300
So shallow.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.980
Judging from the old man's attitude,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.130
Jiang Jiaqi

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.940
is someone we have to win over.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.500
[Subject Statement]

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.340
Boss,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.250
take a look at this.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.950
This is

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:30.580
the subject statement

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.700
for that SUSAR case.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.850
What statement?

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.890
He admitted that,

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.820
when he joined the trial,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.940
he hid his drug allergy history.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.420
But

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.730
our

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.770
SUSAR report was already filed.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.420
Yeah.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.030
[Subject Statement]

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.010
If the subject

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.130
had concealed an allergy to a certain medication,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.300
and during the trial took something

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.820
with a similar active ingredient,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.850
then the adverse reaction

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.130
may not have been caused by SA-0988 after all.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.060
In that case,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.940
our SUSAR report

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.340
might not hold up.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.340
What the company feared most was

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.130
that this SUSAR

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.770
would lead the regulators

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.250
to reject SA-0988 for marketing approval.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.980
It always hits where it hurts.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.700
Right?

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.770
What a coincidence, no?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.940
Pull up all related data

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.180
and reports

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.900
on this subject now.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.570
Okay.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.250
I'll do it right now.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.460
[Deng Ning]

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.180
Hello?

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.770
Did you get it?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.770
The subject statement.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.570
I'm looking at it now.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.530
The project lead

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.700
got it too, I heard.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.290
Recently, did you

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.050
go looking

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.940
for this subject?

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.050
No.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.250
Why would I do something like that?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.180
I only just got the email myself.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.940
An electronic copy?

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.180
A scan.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.810
What I got

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.010
was the original with a signature.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.700
What's your take?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.530
It means whoever's behind this knows exactly

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.220
how adverse reactions

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.530
are reported and the rules around it.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.730
Your Pharmacovigilance Dept

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.940
is the responsible team,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.250
so you got the original,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.460
and we got the scan.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.250
Even the way they handled this

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.940
was pretty professional.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.770
That's overly professional.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.330
Have you had any contact

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.010
with those trial participants?

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.180
Don't worry.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.380
It's been handled properly.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.420
Did you spend any money?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.980
Absolutely not.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.420
The moment money changes hands, it becomes something else.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.460
I understand.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.900
We need to confirm this statement quickly

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.180
and speed up SA-0988's

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.010
marketing approval application.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.290
Understood.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.290
I'm heading out for a bit.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.730
I still think it's necessary

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.490
to verify this

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.250
subject statement.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.380
Boss,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.420
if you go right now,

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.940
won't your intentions be too obvious?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.090
People will think

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.860
you're going against the higher-ups.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.220
What's our duty

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.010
in the PV Dept?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.290
Isn't it to confirm the facts?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.570
If the subject's adverse reaction

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.090
were caused by something else,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.620
there would be no need to report it.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.490
But if it could still

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.420
be related to SA-0988,

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.420
we would have to get to the bottom of it.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.180
PV Dept...

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.180
only makes technical calls.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.530
Then, I'll go with you.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.490
Boss,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.660
wherever you go, I go.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:40.860
I'm coming too.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.380
You two shouldn't come.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.900
This is a personal visit.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.810
Not work.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.730
Besides, if this ends up

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.730
dragging you into it...

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.290
We'll call it a personal visit too.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.380
Exactly.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.420
Fine.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.570
Get ready. We're leaving.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.810

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.490
don't let Tong Rui go.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.860
All right.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.340
Let's go.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.570
Did you bring the subject statement?

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.940
Yes.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.180
Thanks.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.940
Of course.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.090
Here, have some water.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.010
Thank you.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.490
Thank you.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.810
Mr. Wang,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.330
we're here today

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.660
for a brief follow-up.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.860
It's about your father

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.860
taking part in the drug trial earlier,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.050
and a few details

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.090
we need to confirm with you.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.290
Okay.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.200
How is your father doing

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.900
right now?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.940
Still an early stage.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.180
We heard you came forward on your own

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.530
and told our project team

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.810
that you had previously kept quiet

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.220
about your father's drug allergy history.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.570
So what medication

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.660
is your father allergic to?

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.900
Alteplase.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.250
When he had

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.220
the adverse reaction,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.490
why didn't you

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.330
mention that then?

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.290
At the time, my dad

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.570
suddenly couldn't speak.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.090
My first thought

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.220
was that it had to be

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.490
because of the drug trial.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.140
I didn't even think to look for another cause.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.740
[Alarm]

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.090
Give me a second.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.730
Excuse me.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.050
I was worried I'd forget my meds,

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.660
so I set an alarm.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.460
Are you not feeling well?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.330
Uremia.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.010
I need dialysis twice a week.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.660
Because of it,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.220
I can't hold a job.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.490
My treatment costs,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.220
plus my dad's condition,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.730
we simply can't afford them.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.140
If it weren't for our situation,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.660
I would never have had the heart

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.010
to let my dad join the drug trial.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.140
Does your father

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.730
know about

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.700
the situation now?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.940
He does.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.570
Anyway, at this point,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.250
there's no real miracle drug

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.180
for Alzheimer's disease.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.940
Who knows, this new drug

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.770
might actually help?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.180
Not only did it not cost us a thing,

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.090
but we could also earn some money.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.140
Deep down, I know

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.180
he's really doing it

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.490
to make a little money

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.330
and help me out.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.090
When my dad heard he'd passed the physical,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.290
he was pretty happy.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.380
Keep talking.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.490
I'll water the plants.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.860
Dad,

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.250
you already watered them just now.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.770
I did?

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.980
Dad,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:42.860
here.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.090
Go set up the board.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:45.900
In a bit,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:46.940
we'll play a game.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.050
Okay.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.860
Mr. Wang,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.860
aside from treatment

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.660
related to Alzheimer's disease,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.660
his other checkups

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.530
were basically normal.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.140
Has he ever had a cerebral

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.010
or myocardial infarction before?

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.050
No.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.090
Alteplase

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.180
is specifically used

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.660
as an emergency clot-busting drug for cerebral infarction.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.770
Since he hadn't

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.980
ever had a stroke before,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.330
how did you find out

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.010
that he's allergic to Alteplase?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.530
After my dad had a cerebral infarction this time,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.770
I asked the doctor.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.530
The doctor said my dad

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.180
did have an allergic reaction.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.460
Yes, Mr. Wang, I understand.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.050
But if your father

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.010
had never had a stroke

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.050
and never used Alteplase before,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.090
how could you know

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.090
he had an allergy history with Alteplase?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.420
In our family,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.620
we have two people who are sick.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.460
I know

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.770
what it feels like to be waiting on a drug

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.140
to save a life.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.250
If it's because of me

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.330
that the research on this drug gets affected,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.140
I'll feel bad.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.330
Right there, park here.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.050
Just park it in.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.570
Enter.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.420
Just enter and park it,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.140
and that's it.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.980
I'll do a back-in parking.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.660
It'll be easier to exit.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.420
Why are you making it so complicated?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.490
Look.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.730
How do you even drive?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.330
Who parks like that, fighting for a spot?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.700
Isn't this all your fault?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.380
Was that really necessary?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.490
We can look farther up ahead.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.420
Look where you parked it.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.570
In a bit, you'll have to move it for someone.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.420
Was that really necessary?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.090
How is it not necessary?

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.330
You finished all the buns this morning.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.460
I didn't even get breakfast.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.330
My blood sugar's low right now.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.460
When my blood sugar drops, I get snappy.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.290
If I hadn't told Wang

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.220
to get all the food ready,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.050
there would have been nothing left later.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.420
Wang.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.330
Yao,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.290
why are you so late today?

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.010
I had three runs this morning.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.810
I'm worn out.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.330
All these dishes can be added?

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.490
Help yourself, eat whatever you want.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.250
The same goes for those?

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.050
Yeah...

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.570
Chicken leg.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.250
Add a chicken leg.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:20.860
Chicken legs are fine too.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.290
Just pick what you like.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.220
Then, I'll add a chicken leg.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.770
Chicken leg?

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:23.530
Okay.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.140
Five yuan.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.770
All right.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.290
Anything else? Enough?

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.050
Yes, thanks.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.570
That's enough.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.010
Okay.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.660
Come back if you want more.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.420
Isn't that Youyou?

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.220
Mr. Jiang.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.290
She's my nephew's friend,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.700
an actress.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.810
- Hurry, sit down. - Come on.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.220
Sit.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.860
Here.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.140
No wonder you looked so familiar.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.980
Youyou,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:46.770
why did you

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.770
come here for a meal today?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.050
The food here is good.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.420
Fifteen yuan for eight dishes.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.010
And you get a big chicken leg too.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.860
It's a steal.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.940
Right.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.770
Director,

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.770
you don't have a chicken leg.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.700
Have...

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.050
Have a chicken leg and build yourself up.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.770
It's just

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.940
simple home cooking here.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.290
Hope it suits your taste.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.140
It does.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.330
I've got a great appetite.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:10.940
And honestly, your meals here

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.490
are even better

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.570
than what I had on set before.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.220
Right, Director?

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.050
Director?

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.250
So Jialu

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.570
really was a director.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:18.900
Yes.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.860
He used to

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.980
have a short film under his belt.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.330
It even won an award at a film festival.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.220
He's really talented.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.220
Really?

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.090
So Jialu

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.420
was actually a big-time director.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.730
Then, why are you now

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.770
driving a delivery truck with us?

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.570
What was that film of yours

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.050
called again?

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.090
I'll look it up online later.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.010
Come on. Get out of here.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.140
My food...

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.330
I'm not done eating yet.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.860
Say it. What do you want?

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.250
This is strange.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.140
Ten years ago, when you were directing,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.490
I didn't even dare look at you.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.770
The moment I did, I got scared.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.250
Now, the more I look at you,

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.180
the more agreeable you seem.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.940
Enough already.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.140
You're clearly holding your breath,

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.250
waiting to make a comeback

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.420

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.050
right?

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.090
Listen.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.660
No movies.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.860
No directing. No creating.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.140
Right now, I'm just

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.140
a courier.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.330
I never planned on going back.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.620
You just came here

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.330
to laugh at me, didn't you?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.530
Now that you've seen enough,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.180
you can leave now.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.980
I'm not here to laugh at you.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.530
Why did you stop being a director?

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.220
Why did you stop creating?

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.490
Can't you understand plain words?

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.700
Please

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.700
stop appearing in front of me.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.180
All right?

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.660
But I feel happy every time I see you.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.980
I honestly want to see you every day.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.900
Before, I pitied you.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.620
I'll tell you the truth.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.180
I know these past years

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.860
haven't been easy for you.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.330
You've been unhappy and stuck.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.860
But have you ever thought about it?

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.730
It's been ten years.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.490
Whether it was singing

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.250
or acting,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.620
if you truly had the ability,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.380
you would've made it long ago.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.420
Would you still be like this now?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.330
Once or twice, you can blame others.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.180
But ten years?

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.460
Who do you blame, then?

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.180
So, don't push the responsibility

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.050
onto me, all right?

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.330
Okay?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.330
You're simply incompetent.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.980
Why is there no printer paper again?

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.860
I'm talking to you.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.900
Where's the printer paper?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.140
Are you treating my words like nothing?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.860
Zhou Yu'an, I'm telling you,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.010
I've put up with you for a long time!

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.420
I only held back because you're a woman.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.220
If you were a man,

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.620
I would've hit you already!

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.700
Zhou Yu'an, come out here.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.180
I have to say this to her today.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.570
Calm down.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.010
I have to make her come out today.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.460
- I need to make things clear with her. - Calm down.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.460
- Calm down. - Listen.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.620
I must make everything clear today!

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.330
Dong Yalin!

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.860
I just...

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.530
Go on. What exactly happened?

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.730
Boss,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.330
you know

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.380
he never liked

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.250
that girl.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.140
Isn't Zhou Yu'an always like that?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.290
But we never saw Dong

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.250
lose his temper like that.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.090
Well, maybe that was because

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.420
of what happened at the gathering.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.420
I was there too.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.860
What else happened?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.980
That day, when you and Song Hong went out,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.900
she slapped Dong Yalin.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.770
Why?

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.250
Well...

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.620
We drank a bit too much that day.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.620
I don't really remember it.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.180
What is going on between you and Dong Yalin?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.050
Why did you hit him?

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.730
I dislike him,

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.900
so I hit him.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.980
Does disliking someone justify hitting him?

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.570
What did he do to you?

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.140
Did he insult you

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.050
and say something offensive?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.700
Tell me. Why exactly?

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.620
He said you were weak.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.770
He also said your junior is walking all over you

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.810
because your junior is capable,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.770
and at your age,

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.980
if you're still being publicly humiliated,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.980
that's entirely your own doing.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:05.810
Did I really

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.290
say that?

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.250
Yes.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.730
You've got quite a mouth on you.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.570
Boss.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.770
Dong Yalin, you've gotten quite bold, haven't you?

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.140
You even dared speak disrespectfully to me.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.010
How outrageous.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.900
Apologize to me right now.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.770
Boss.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.330
I'm sorry.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.050
Say it ten times.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Boss, I love you.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.660
Crazy.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.490
Who hasn't spoken badly about someone

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.380
behind their back at some point?

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.900
Once it's said, it's said.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.620
Why not just pretend you never heard it?

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:28.660
Why insist on bringing it up?

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.810
Thanks for standing up for me.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.530
Dinner's on me.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.290
Between people,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.570
there are things you can't just say casually.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.140
If you hear someone

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.250
speaking ill of your friend,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.090
telling your friend about it

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.340
will just make things

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.090
awkward between you.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.980
In the end,

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.050
you might not even stay friends.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.940
But if you already know,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.090
how can you really pretend you don't?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.420
That's the rule of being an adult.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.340
As long as you act like you don't know,

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.780
you can treat it

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.740
as if nothing ever happened.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.090
But that fear

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.380
of being found out

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.260
can weigh on you

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.210
until you can hardly breathe.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.380
Every time you meet someone,

you can't help wondering

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.860
if they know.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.210
And if they do, would they still accept you?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.860
You have to stay tense every single day
