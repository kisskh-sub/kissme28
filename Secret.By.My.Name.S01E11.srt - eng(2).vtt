(Tan Group Flagship Store
Building Collapse Incident Report)

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.618
(Eight years ago.)

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.779
(It happened
at the exact time my father died.)

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.779
(And Tan Group never disclosed
this incident to the public.)

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.899
(All news, reports, and records)

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.619
(were deliberately erased.)

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.699
(Not even in the shareholders' meeting archives
is there any trace of it.)

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.339
(What exactly were they trying to hide?)

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500
Help me look into something.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.899
The Tan Group flagship store
collapse from eight years ago.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.939
You're still up this late?

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.060
If you run into any trouble,

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.739
you should tell me.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.060
As long as you speak up,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.780
I'll do everything I can for you.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140
Then wire me some money.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.739
Let's start with

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.860
ten billion.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.819
I'm joking.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.739
Didn't realize you were that rich.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.420
Don't work yourself too hard lately.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:56.860
Get some rest.

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.019
(Liang Yusheng, I found
the former flagship store manager)

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.939
Who is it?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.019
(I found
the former flagship store manager.)

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:15.819
Little boy.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.180
Long time no see, Uncle Zhao.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.740
Do you remember me?

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.379
I'm Li Zhengzhi's daughter.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.099
I don't know you.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.900
Leave now.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.139
Uncle Zhao.

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.859
I came today to hear a story.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300
Do you still remember, eight years ago,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.740
the Tan Group flagship store collapse?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.659
A lot of people died in that accident.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.778
Don't push me.

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.979
Leave. Now.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.740
What are you trying to do, Uncle Zhao?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.379
Send me to meet my father?

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.819
You remember this photo, don't you?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.539
Aren't they all your friends?

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.500
Uncle Zhao,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.299
if you want to live in peace,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.379
don't carry debts on your back.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.539
(Dad.)

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.460
(I'm about to clear your name.)

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.220
Tan Jianfei, stop right there!

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.739
Tan Jianfei!

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.260
Give it back to me!

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.978
Let go of me!

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.260
Let go of me!

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.059
You call this your secret?

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.380
Tan Jianfei. (Support Admin Watch on

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.699
Do you have any idea

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.539
how much it took for me

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.859
to get this evidence?

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.349
Shujing.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.460
So as long as someone stands
in the way of your revenge,

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.619
you'll kick them aside
without hesitation?

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.460
I was the fool.

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.299
For ever trusting someone
with the surname Tan.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:09.940
Tan Jianfei.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.820
Don't make me hate you even more.

and his shop, search again.

of the videotapes.
