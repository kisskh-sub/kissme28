00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.759
Give it to Sambu Island

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.640
Colonel Oshima.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.800
Tell him the truth.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.000
why Kamakura Ikami died.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.560
Tell him.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080
I can bear the shock.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.320
If you need help,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.160
please call and explain directly.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.360
No need to hide. Okay.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.160
Yes.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.130
I'll go and generate the power as you ordered.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.120
Gather around!

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.400
Let's go!

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.440
Yes.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.560
Send him a telegram.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.360
Ask him to send an official

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.040
from the police station.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160
Isn't this over?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.730
The sixth place.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.000
The anti-spy.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.280
If something is wrong with Colonel Takemichi,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.080
it's all thanks to the police.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.079
If it’s wrong,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.520
it's also a mistake.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240
the police station's fault.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.000
Sir.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.360
[Incoming call from Shanghai Jing Mansion.]

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.560
to ask about the real cause

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.120
the real cause of death.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.450
and is willing to provide us with any help.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.680
Call Mr. Irigami

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.200
Mr. Inasaki.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.060
Mr. Yaozu Urigami, Inashimi Apartment.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.040
The cause of death

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.320
is currently under investigation.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.640
Inashimi Apartment, please cooperate.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.800
Arrange the sixth location of Tokyo Police Agency

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.720
and ask them to send an expert to the island for investigation.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.920
Sign, Oshima Hao.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.880
Airlines 6.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.960
Colonel Oshima is calling.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.520
The cause of death of Kamakura is still under investigation.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680
If he dies in war,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.000
it's fine to die for the Emperor.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.960
I can't believe he died so mysteriously.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.280
I won't let this slide.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.640
The Empire of Japan is on the island.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.760
with over 10,000 soldiers.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.680
How could they die like this?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.480
My Lord, don't be angry.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.400
That place

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
is the back of the Imperial Navy.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.360
We'll figure it out.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.680
Since the Navy of the Japanese Empire

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.320
has made Sambu Island a airline base,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.880
that island has been sealed tightly.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360
No outsiders can enter.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.200
Yes.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.560
Outsiders

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.960
Outsiders can't get in.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.240
Speaking of outsiders,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.080
are only sent by the palace.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.840
Colonel and his woman.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.360
You suspect the colonel

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.760
and his lover?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.880
Since this arrogant colonel

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.880
on the island,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.680
the island has been in turmoil.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.360
Some things have to be suspected.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm stupid.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.320
Please enlighten me.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.400
Colonel Oshima

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.640
to investigate

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.440
called Ye Biying.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.680
But...

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.200
whether it's the rice store owner

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.640
or a doctor.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.920
I don't remember her.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.080
All her experiences

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.520
was deliberately decorated.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.520
You're right.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.440
We sent to the dance hall

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.840
we sent to

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.480
didn't bring back any news.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.159
It seems that this dance hall

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.520
is really a hidden place.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.680
a hidden place.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.360
How's the progress?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640
We haven't found anything yet.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.480
Go to Banzai Club.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040
to gather some members.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.520
We must

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.080
take some measures.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080
Yes, sir.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.920
Interpreter Na.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.800
A lady wants to see you.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.280
Okay.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.240
Thank you.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.640
Mr. Na.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.120
You go first.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.000
Did you hear that the island lifted the sea ban

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.560
and let the fishermen sail?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.240
I know

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.160
I know.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.400
I couldn't sleep

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.160
because of this.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.120
My brother is on the list too.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.800
But as you know,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.440
he's not a fisherman.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.840
He doesn't know how to fish.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.640
Why did you send him to sea?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.040
I understand

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.920
I understand how you feel now.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.520
This is not simple.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.800
I'm here

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.360
to ask you about it.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.240
Can I not go to sea?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.920
Miss Ye,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.800
This matter

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.600
has nothing to do with the headquarters.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.720
What about lifting the sea ban?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.640
It's the police force.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.360
To celebrate the Emperor's birthday,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.000
to celebrate the Emperor's birthday.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.640
a civilian operation.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.280
It should be fine.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.720
If that's the case,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.080
why did you force everyone

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.159
to sail?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.800
It's forced.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.240
Don't you know?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.720
Hello, captain.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.160
I found out

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.560
Yes.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.440
Where?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160
Fukuda from Fukuda Company.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.480
with Fukuda.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.360
Who else drank with you?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.640
Just the two of them.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.880
I'm going to send a car.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.280
to send Fukuda here.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.120
Okay.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.920
Send him here.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.800
Okay.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.720
You're the big star

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.520
in front of Commander Fujita.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.960
It's a big deal.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.920
the police will definitely

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.080
to the commander.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
Do you have any inside information?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.760
I...

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.039
I'm not a celebrity.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.600
I just

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.559
I'm always in front of the commander.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.080
But I'm still a Chinese.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.539
He doesn't trust me at all.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.159
Can you please

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.620
confirm something for me?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.920
Is sailing dangerous?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.040
What can I do?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.800
My authority.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.000
I can't

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.280
at all.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.760
Can you do me a favor?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.720
Miss Ye,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.540
It's not that I don't want to help you.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.560
I can't help you with this.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.040
I can't help you.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960
There are so many people on the island

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.480
are in danger.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.200
When you see this danger,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.560
when you see the danger.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.240
Do you want to see them die?

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.480
You said it yourself.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.850
You're Chinese too.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.760
How could you say that?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.440
I can.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.000
Just because of one possibility,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.760
put myself

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.120
in danger?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.920
Also,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.560
you can't even protect yourself today.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.680
Well,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.320
I'll only tell you something.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.120
I'm just a scholar.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.760
I'm like an ant.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.440
like an ant.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.120
I really want to help you.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.120
I can't

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.200
I can't help you.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.880
Can you stop looking at me like that?

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.520
I can forget

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.960
what you told me today.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.680
I hope

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.440
you can stop thinking about it as soon as possible.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.900
Don't do anything stupid.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.040
Ye Xiao.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.080
Say it!

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.360
Lieutenant Ikegami.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.480
What else did he say to you?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.800
What did the well say?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240
I don't know.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.440
I don't know.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.680
Stop doing useless work.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.380
Report to the captain.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000
Let's go back.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.320
Hurry up.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.320
It's raining heavily.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.250
You came to me early in the morning.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.160
Open it.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.960
Okay.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.040
Come in.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.400
Slow down.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840
Why are you here?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.240
About lifting the sea ban,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.600
I asked Luo Zhiyong.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.520
He's a coward.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.920
He doesn't say anything.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.440
But I can.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.360
From his expression,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.720
as you said,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.720
It's not simple.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
We need to check.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.130
Did I allow you to go?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.810
Did you discuss it with me before you went?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.080
This matter

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.320
has something to do with my family.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.760
It has something to do with the whole village.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.360
I think Luo Zhiyong

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.690
will be a breakthrough.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.520
Have you ever thought

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.880
what Fujita would think

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.010
what would he think?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.540
I promised you I would find out the truth.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.800
But now,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.000
is already troublesome enough.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.130
So be extra careful.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.320
If we make a mistake,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.850
we will lose the whole game.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.680
So from now on,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
no matter what decision you make,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.340
can you discuss with me first?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.920
Got it.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.170
Let's go.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.820
Where are we going?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.610
Where else can we go?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.440
To my room.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.520
Wait for me.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.960
It's not good.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.360
No.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.160
Where are you going?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.360
I need to go to the hospital.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:26.880
It should be

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.280
should be lively enough.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.570
Let’s go.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.320
Colonel.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.560
As you ordered,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.000
We're all ready.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.040
Habha.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.680
Take out your pay.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.120
to add so much nutrients

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.920
for the injured in our squadron.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.480
We're really touched.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.160
Don't say that.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.240
They got hurt

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.640
because of my investigation.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.100
I'm responsible for that.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.800
Come in.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.360
Sit down.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360
Okay.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.200
Thank you.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.080
Have a seat.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.880
I heard the well went to your place.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.000
What did he do?

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.240
He did come.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.480
You set him up with another woman?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.320
Yes.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.880
He asked me if I have new products.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.840
Speaking of new products,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.920
only

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.960
the local woman he sent.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.640
That woman from the well.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.480
Is that Hye Hye?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.800
It's her.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.520
That ungrateful woman.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.520
went crazy.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.800
He bit Captain Ikegami.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.400
Now...

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.200
Captain Sasaki.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.400
She's asking me.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.810
What happened next?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.040
Then...

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760
Captain Irigami

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.760
He went to the base hospital to bandage his wound.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.160
Was he drunk at that time?

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.960
No.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.640
I'm very sober.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.320
He drove his motorcycle.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.160
Are you sure?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.560
Of course.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.400
Of course.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.360
Hospital?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.600
Hospital?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.840
Does Sasaki know about this?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.720
Yes.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.880
He’ll go to the hospital

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.520
after the interrogation.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.240
Let's go to the hospital.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.080
Let's go to the well.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.720
Yes.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.480
Don't get up.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.760
I wish you a speedy recovery.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.520
Where are you going?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.440
Today is the comfort center.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.800
at the comfort center.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.520
We have an important investigation today.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.200
You can't go out.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.840
Today is the routine check.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.600
I'll be back soon.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.640
No.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.440
We have to get investigated first.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.200
Let's go to the office.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.760
Let's go.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.360
Have a seat.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.040
That afternoon,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.400
Have you seen the well in the hospital?

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.480
Yes.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.000
Yes.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.200
Tell me.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.520
Nurse Tang.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.120
Come and bandage him.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.450
I'll get some medicine.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.160
Is that all?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.720
Do you have a witness?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.240
The one on duty that day...

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.600
was Dr. Jin.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.360
Dr. Jin can prove

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.240
I was on duty that day.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.960
Do you trust her?

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.480
Yes.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.490
That day, Captain Irigami, I was the patient.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.560
Irigami.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.600
When did you leave?

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.280
After that,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.120
I went to the ICU

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.800
to take care of other patients.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.200
I haven't seen Captain Irigami.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.520
Okay.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.880
You can go now.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.760
Let's go.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.440
I don't know

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.240
is true or not.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.720
If you need to

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.640
as soon as possible,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.360
it's all about imagination.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.360
Have you really never seen Captain Ikegami?

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.160
No.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.360
I didn't see him.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.560
Forced imagination.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.280
Think about your family.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.720
What were you doing?

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.040
Think about your parents.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.320
or the person you love.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.680
No.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.520
Did you see anyone

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.880
in the hospital?

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.170
Have you seen a motorcycle?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.000
Did you see when Captain Irigami left?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.760
No.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.640
Try to recall

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.240
if anything happened in the hospital.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.440
Let's go.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.200
Let the hospital's garrison

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.720
to the corridor.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.560
Yes.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.650
The well came to the hospital that afternoon.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.320
I'm investigating this matter.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.280
I want to know

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.680
more details.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.760
Salute.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960
At ease.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.720
Who was on duty yesterday afternoon?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.000
Step forward.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.800
Sir.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.600
It's me.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.600
The rest of you may leave.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.760
Follow me.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.680
Yes.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.240
When you were on duty,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.040
when you were on duty?

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.080
Yes.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.600
What did he say?

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:39.960
I don't know.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.780
He came with a motorcycle.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.680
Have you seen him leave?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.600
Yes.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.300
He was in the hospital for a while.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.760
and left with a motorcycle.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.200
Are you sure?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.520
Yes.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.480
when you were on duty,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.880
when you were on duty?

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.760
Captain.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.320
Who do you mean?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.560
We heard Captain Irigami

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.920
had an accident.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.880
There were people from each team coming to the hospital that day.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.560
I don't remember.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.120
Think about it.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.920
Colonel Takemuki from Tokyo.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.120
came to the hospital.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.320
That day, his car

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.320
was broken in front of the hospital.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.200
He asked me to push his car

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.920
to push his car.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.200
Did Colonel come here too?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.280
Are you sure?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.280
Yes.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.760
Recall it again.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.800
Irigami and Colonel.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.360
Who left the hospital first?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.640
What are you looking at?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.080
Hurry up!

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.520
Yes.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:10.920
That's right.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.760
Irigami left first.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.200
When I was pushing his bike,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.320
Lieutenant Irigami left on his motorcycle.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.640
Look carefully.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.640
Is it Captain Irigami?

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.800
Look closely.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.440
It's definitely Captain Irigami.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.400
What you just said

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.080
to anyone.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.040
Yes.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.720
Captain!

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.360
Sasaki.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.090
You're here.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.720
Did the sentry mention Colonel?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.760
Yes.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.520
He said he met Colonel.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.170
Captain, you’re right.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.540
Irigami met Colonel in the hospital.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.560
Before Colonel Irigami

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.200
before Colonel.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.440
Where did he go?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.800
I don’t know.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.560
Why is Colonel here?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.320
I think he's here

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.050
to visit the wounded soldiers.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.860
Looks like you care about this place.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.720
We found out

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.320
when Captain Irigami died,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.180
Colonel was also in the hospital.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.440
When he died in the well,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.040
Colonel was in the hospital.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.880
What else did he do in the hospital?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880
I don't know.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.840
I only know

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.960
after Irigami left,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.840
Colonel left too.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.880
Do you think he went to follow him?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.240
According to the temperament of the well,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.640
I won't let this woman go.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.800
Where is she now?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.000
She's at Fukuda's place.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.080
I'm keeping an eye on him.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.010
We can't escape.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.680
That's right.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.960
Bring that woman.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.560
Bring that woman.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.200
Send someone to investigate

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.800
where Colonel is now.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.680
Got it.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.160
Someone jumped off the building.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.000
Who is it?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.420
Go down and have a look.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.720
Sir.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.920
The woman called Hye Hye at the comfort center

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.480
died.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.720
Look at what you've done!

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.280
You fool!

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.760
Let's go!

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.050
Heavy 05693.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.760
What are you doing?

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.120
You can't even watch a woman.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.440
I'm really sorry.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.640
Captain.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.680
I found out

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.080
where he is now.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.240
Where is it?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.840
I'm in the garage with the commander.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.720
You may leave.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.400
Yes.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.280
Let's go to Colonel.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:32.960
Yes.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.800
Commander.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.560
You wanted to see me?

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.290
You're here.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.680
Look at this

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.480
What?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.840
This is the military order

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.170
It was sent this morning

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.040
In the radio station in China today,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.760
in English.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.040
American plane

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.680
Bombed Tokyo yesterday.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.240
Five minutes later,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.000
officially avoided the rumor.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.280
It proves that this news is ridiculous

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.280
and denied it.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.280
They created

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.600
unnecessary panic.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.920
What's the point?

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.120
Actually,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.480
It's just a trick

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.040
of Major Yamamoto 56.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.800
to let the Americans know

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.640
So we can only come up with

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.400
such a foolish idea?

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.570
After the Pearl Port incident,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.720
Yamamoto 56.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.240
I have a bad feeling.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.520
The Americans will come for revenge.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.160
will come to bombing Tokyo.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.120
General Yamamoto

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.580
is not entirely worrying.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640
I think so too.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.760
Bombing Tokyo

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.400
It's just a matter of time.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.240
Just like me,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.080
for many years like me.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.440
He knows Americans always

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.560
actual interests.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.760
These Americans

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.440
can do anything.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.280
Then Commander,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.280
Do you think Americans

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.680
will blow up Tokyo?

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.160
A hundred days ago,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.060
Americans suffered a big loss at Pearl Port.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.040
They will

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.040
to get it back.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.120
Tokyo!

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.650
Isn't that the best place for revenge?

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.080
If that's the case,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.640
we'll be in big trouble!

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:38.760
Tokyo is now...

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.360
Except for our close guards,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.960
except our guards.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.040
And it's a surprise attack at Pearl Port.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.440
Although the result is exhausting

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.560
Nam-woon is a rich man.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.840
In the general's original plan,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.760
Taking down the navigator

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.920
is the top target.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.240
In the end,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.600
at Pearl Port.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.040
The three navigators of the Pacific Marine

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.880
are still intact.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.240
I heard that

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.680
the Americans have changed.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.440
The commander of the Pacific fleet.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.560
Yes, I heard.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.840
Americans

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.720
sent another astronaut.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.520
General Nimiz is the commander.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.960
It could be...

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.080
he will

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.880
in his own way.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.440
A surprise attack to Tokyo!

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.080
The west coast of the US is around

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.360
from Tokyo.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.290
With their ability,

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.050
they can't do it yet.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.840
I'm not sure.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.000
Sir!

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.520
Captain wants you to go to the telecom room.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.640
There's a message.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.280
I'll go now.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.080
Again!

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.480
Tokyo was bombed

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.640
four American planes.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.720
Where did these planes take off?

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.520
No matter where they took off,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.400
But one thing is for sure.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.440
This is the first bombing

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.960
to Tokyo.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.160
Ridiculous!

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.480
There's still news from the captain.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.800
This is Japanese.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.200
I'm from

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.040
British News Media.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.800
is the largest rumor organization in the world.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.240
A few Americans

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.840
bombed the Philippines.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.520
but it was a lie.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.760
Tokyo was bombed.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.080
This is nonsense!

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.200
The air-defence of Tokyo, the Empire of Japan.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.800
The sea, land, air, and space cannot be broken.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.080
I think

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.080
by the Japanese.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.140
It's just a trick of the Japanese.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.760
Let's go for a smoke.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.120
Last month,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.480
sent a battle report.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.200
The American Navy attacked the MaShal Islands.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.600
and the Gilbert Islands.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.330
This proves that

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.600
these worries are not groundless.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.120
Thank you.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.800
Is it that serious?

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.360
It's more serious than I thought.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.800
After the Pearl Port incident,

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.040
I didn't expect the Pacific fleet

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.900
regained their vitality so soon.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.160
The general has ordered

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.320
to increase the sea defense.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.360
I heard this

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.640
in Tokyo.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.160
I don't want to hear it.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.640
Tokyo was attacked.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.040
This terrible news

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.040
only Yamamoto 56 general

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.800
can come up with this idea.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.880
He was a born gambler.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840
So until now,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.920
the casino in Las Vegas

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.640
General Yamamoto is forbidden to enter.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.500
I'm afraid that he can always win.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.160
Rumor has it that

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.600
the promise

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.360
to the Emperor.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.480
His Majesty was going to summon him back.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.840
He told the Emperor

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.720
if you give me a little more time,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.120
I can win a airship for you

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.280
at Las Vegas Casino in America.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.120
Actually,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.320
those people in the base camp

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.120
must have made a huge mistake.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.200
Those idiots

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.160
They see America

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.800
as a shabby house that can kick down the fight with one kick.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.160
The foolish officers

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.160
I heard the Navy's generals

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.120
didn't agree to attack Pearl Port.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.040
Is that so?

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.240
I've been in America for five years.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.680
I know there must be a problem.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.400
What is it?

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.240
The people in Base Camp

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.960
If there's a chance,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.360
fly to the sky of New York.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.600
Look at that city.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.240
A wilen chimney

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.700
and developed industries

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.440
will never

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.320
make such a plan easily.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.040
American industries

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.880
is indeed more advanced than us.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.640
In the end,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.880
It's not about the Navy,

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.880
nor the Army.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.720
or strategies.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.640
but the strength of a country.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Commander.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.080
What you said

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.440
are all senior officers like you.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.690
And what the superiors care about.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.440
I heard from my woman that

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.570
the island is going to lift the sea ban.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.880
I heard that

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.360
That's true.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.520
It's the Special Forces Police Brigade at the base.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.679
Get ready.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.440
It was the Day of Eternal Life.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.400
They haven't told me

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.560
The villagers

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.000
knew about it.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.800
Captain Oshima did this

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.560
did a good thing.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.760
When I was an assistant in the US,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.360
I often heard Americans say

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.090
A drop of honey is more valuable

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.600
can catch flies.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.520
I've told them

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.880
I told them many times.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.560
But they still

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.120
to catch flies with their guts.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.480
Captain Oshima?

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.600
He's really

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.800
in trouble recently.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.600
His deputy captain Irigami

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.730
Something happened again these days.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.880
I heard about it.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.000
It's said that

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.290
the vice-captain Ikegami is dead.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.280
He died for no reason.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.360
Oshima.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.180
You haven't greeted Colonel Takemichi yet.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.240
How's

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240
on the well?

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.200
Your Special Forces Police Brigade

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.730
has been in trouble lately.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.320
We are

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.760
is under investigation.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.440
Colonel.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.720
I don’t know if I can

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.560
in private.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.440
It's raining heavily outside.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.640
Come in and talk.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.240
Nothing.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.720
in front of the commander.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.560
Please understand.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.880
I need to ask you a few questions.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.920
Go ahead.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.480
My subordinate, First Lieutenant Kamakura Irikami, died.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.160
He rode a motorcycle

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.400
on a motorcycle.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.000
I heard about it.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920
I just talked to the Commander

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.760
That's right.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.400
I'm sorry.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
He drank before he died.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.930
I heard about it too.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.680
That's strange.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.440
That place is too remote.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.720
Not even a dog.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.680
Did he go to a place like that

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.080
to drink?

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.040
Are you sure

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.640
Was there only a trace of him?

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.120
No other woman.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.280
We didn't find anyone at the scene.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.200
on the scene.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.760
But before that,

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.320
he was bitten by a woman.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.780
so he went to the hospital.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.240
Then you should go find

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.720
the woman who bit him.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.280
Why are you here?

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.720
Colonel.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.320
He went to the military hospital

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.000
He went to the military hospital.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.200
You also went to the military hospital.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.620
I went there every day.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.200
There.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.480
You must have met Captain Irigami.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.040
I didn't.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.130
Then why did you go to the hospital?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.160
Commander.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.360
Is my investigation

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.680
report to the special forces?

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.040
Oshima.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.240
You should watch your language.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.280
Commander.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.480
Not long before Inosuke died,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.560
before he died.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.400
Colonel.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.320
It was about that time.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.800
I went to the military hospital.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.960
But the doctors

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.120
have never seen Colonel

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.560
in the hospital.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.020
And Colonel said he went to the hospital.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.120
I need to know.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.080
why Colonel

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.640
to the hospital.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.360
So you're saying

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.520
I ran into First Lieutenant Ikegami at the hospital.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.320
and killed him.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.280
Really?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.560
I was just saying

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.040
died in the hospital.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.720
He didn't say he was killed in the hospital.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.280
The sentry in the hospital saw

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.600
He left with a motorcycle on the well.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.720
Since someone saw him,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.920
driving away,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.840
Does it have anything to do

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.000
in the hospital?

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.760
Oshima-san.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.880
When you suspect your superior,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.440
you must have solid evidence.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.480
Otherwise, shut up.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.360
One's personality

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.120
decides one's fate.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.880
Your personality

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.640
you're destined to achieve nothing.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.280
I'm asking you a question, Habha.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.680
Do you think I'll answer you?

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.720
Oshima!

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.880
You have no evidence now.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.440
You're still here.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.040
with your superiors.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.240
I'm leaving.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.200
Get lost!

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.680
Goodbye.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.280
Commander.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.960
I think I should

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.080
to report to you.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.320
I'm going to the hospital for the past few days

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.840
to visit the injured in the arsenal squadron.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.720
I also asked

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.880
who were on duty

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.360
on duty

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.480
All the soldiers in the high-shot squadron

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.640
can testify for me

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.520
Don't take it to heart.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.640
Da Dao Hao

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.840
is involved in his own mess.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840
I was too anxious.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.800
I didn't manage my subordinates well.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.640
It was my negligence.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.440
As the Emperor's investigator,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.760
I came to the Navy base behind me.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.640
I'm the first one

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.320
I think I'm the first one.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.560
Make time.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.400
I'll teach him a lesson.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.560
See you.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.160
Colonel.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.640
Don't get angry with him.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.320
Sakamoto.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.000
Yes.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.800
Find out

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.920
Why does Colonel always go to the military hospital?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.400
Look.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.280
He left the hospital on the well,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.360
and didn't return to the comfort center.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.490
to take revenge on that comfort woman.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.960
During this period,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.520
something happened in the well.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.440
His body and motorcycle

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.900
appeared under the cliff.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.040
But apart from

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.960
Colonel Takemuki and Inaki

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.920
at the same time.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.000
The point is the hospital isn't either.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.880
The place where Inupstairs died.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.840
The hospital wasn't where the well died.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.760
He grabbed the sufficient reason

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.720
and enlarge it in public

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.850
to avoid suspicion.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.920
You mean...

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.480
Let's put that aside,

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.280
based on the time of death

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.160
the time of death,

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.480
whether the time he was in the hospital

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.600
in the hospital?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.640
Okay.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.040
Should I call

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.840
the sentry who was on guard that day?

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.640
Let's check the details again.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640
Okay.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.480
Keep it secret.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.160
Yes.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.890
We can't rule out Takemichi's suspicion.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.440
I've been thinking about it these days.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.920
wherever he went,

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.720
there will be trouble.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040
So,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.800
it's not a bad thing these days.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.480
We've got a lot of clues.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.360
Looks like

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.480
Macau Rongze's suggestion

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.640
is correct.
