00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.300
We have guests today?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.550
It's Madam's birthday.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.840
Mr. Xiao should be coming.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.040
Better to prepare more than not enough.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.870
I'll go.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.240
At least you show some filial piety.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.840
It's not your place to judge.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.270
On New Year's Eve,

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.000
Mrs. Xiao literally
hustled around for nothing.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.720
Zhiyu?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Welcome, Zhiyu.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.360
Now our whole family is here.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.600
Come on,

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.680
let's eat.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.480
Mrs. Xiao,

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.000
happy birthday.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.240
I was just about to ask someone

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.830
to buy me this set of tools.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.080
I noticed the tools
you were using before weren't very handy,

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.480
so I thought of giving you
a set of good ones.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.270
He's

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.080
so good at picking gifts.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.180
Last year, when you were into painting,

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.240
he got you an easel.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.750
This year, you're interested in gardening,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.810
so he got you tools.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.400
That's so thoughtful of you, Zhen.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.270
Thank you.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.480
I'm glad you like it.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.310
Happy birthday.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.240
I remember

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.790
when I was little,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.410
you loved listening to her songs.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.350
Yes,

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.160
that was many years ago.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.790
Do you like it?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.810
Where did you get it?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.830
Is it a genuine one?

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.550
Of course.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.770
I had someone bring it from Hong Kong.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.310
Now that the children
have given their gifts,

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.640
I'd like to make a toast.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.640
Wish you

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.600
a happy birthday, Wanyue.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.750
Thanks to Wanyue,

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.810
we are reunited here as a family.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.470
Cheers.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.000
I'll drive.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.360
So let me toast with tea.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.810
I'd like to take this chance

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.740
to wish our two companies
a successful partnership.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.160
Zhiyu,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.240
I'm so happy that you're

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.740
working with Zhen.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.750
Mrs. Xiao,

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.360
don't worry about the work.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.720
Zhiyu and I will cooperate well.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.640
You both work so hard.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.920
I'm not worried about your careers.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.240
But your marriages are

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.290
what I'm concerned about.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.680
You're not getting any younger.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.340
Why aren't you dating anyone?

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.400
Young people

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.210
should focus on their careers.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.790
Marriage can wait.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.310
No need to rush into marriage.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.440
But they should at least date someone.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.030
Don't you even have a girl you like?

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.670
Mrs. Xiao,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.620
I'm in love with a girl.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.310
I'll bring her to meet you
when I get the chance.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.020
That's wonderful.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.440
What's she like?

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.590
She's very smart

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.750
and cute, too.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.750
We met at work.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I admire her a lot.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.450
You met at work?

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.630
Does she also work in construction?

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.630
A designer?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.790
Yes.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.200
I really like her way of doing things.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.000
And also,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.770
she understands me very well.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.460
What does her family do?

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.790
I'm not quite sure about that.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.650
But according to what I've heard,

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.790
her father

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.290
should be an engineer.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.010
Just an ordinary family.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.200
A regular engineer.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.790
Her family background must be ordinary.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.520
A girl like that can't help you.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.400
She's not worth your time.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.400
You should focus on your work instead.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.960
So your standards for a spouse are

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.750
so pragmatic, Uncle Pei.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.440
Zhiyu,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.740
that's not what your Uncle Pei meant.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.640
Let's eat now.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.960
Zhiyu,

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.550
are you sure you won't stay a bit longer?

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.530
I still have work to deal with.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.120
I'll see him out, Mrs. Xiao.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.310
We can talk about work on the way.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.400
Okay.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.679
Be careful on your way.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.239
Alright.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.480
There's no problem
with the supplier info this time, right?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.679
When will we sign the project contract?

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.510
That depends on Lyman's side.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.040
The financial audit
probably isn't done yet.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.139
This is the standard procedure.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:39.139
I also want to push forward quickly,

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.400
but I can't interfere.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.000
Fine.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.670
Then we'll wait for news from Lyman.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.690
You'd better not mention her
in front of your father.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.630
Who are you to make demands of me?

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.710
In other words,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.590
what are you to her?

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.470
You heard what your father said
during the meal.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.970
You know what kind of person he is

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.160
better than I do.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.250
Pei Zhen,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.550
don't let your wishful thinking

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.070
cause Hu Xiu any harm.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.690
She has no obligation
to face your father with you.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.780
Mr. Xiao, are you there?

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.150
[Hu Xiu]

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.710
Do you have anything to report to me?

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.070
Mr. Xiao,

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.070
I was reviewing those materials yesterday

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.440
until 3 a.m.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.500
Does that count as working overtime?

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880
So you just got up?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880
While I was going through the materials,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.210
I got some inspiration.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.950
Would you like to hear it?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.030
On our first day of dating,

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.490
are you sure
you want to bring up work with me?

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.510
Do you have any other plans then?

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.590
Go home.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.560
Alright.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.000
Then I'll go to Regard Café

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.800
to help Zhao
prepare for the collaboration event.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.770
Do you have something urgent to do
at home?

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.480
Yes, I do have something important to do.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.540
I'm going to meet someone important.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.880
Who is it?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.980
Wait, someone is knocking at my door.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.230
You're not washing your hair, are you?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.030
It's not like I haven't seen you
with greasy hair before.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.240
That's different.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.880
Dating etiquette.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.190
During the 3 months of "honeymoon" phase,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.790
you can't see your boyfriend
with greasy hair.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.620
Dating etiquette?

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.130
You seem quite experienced.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.630
Are you upset?

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.730
Are you upset for real?

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.440
Head down.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.450
Only 3 months in the "honeymoon" phase?

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.750
Your ex wasn't that great then.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.320
I'll dry my hair.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.790
And then let's go watch a movie?

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:54.280
Okay.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.710
What do you want to watch?

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.710
Anything is fine.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.260
[Handwash]

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.630
What did you wash your hair with?

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:06.550
Shampoo, of course.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.760
What else would I use?

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.670
Oh, no.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.030
I was so busy talking to you

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.560
that I ended up
using hand sanitizer instead.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:20.250
My hair is ruined.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.690
I won't go bald, will I?

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.440
What now?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.260
You're so violent with yourself.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.630
My hair feels

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.670
even worse

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.930
than when you arrived.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.660
Come on.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.790
It's all falling out.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.820
Smells so good.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.610
Isn't this the coconut oil Zhao gave me?

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.370
It's now the best
for emergency hair treatment.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.920
This can work?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.510
Yes.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.880
The only downside is

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.510
that you might get coconut flakes
falling from your hair later.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.570
Coconut flakes...

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.980
What a cringy joke.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.880
You're quite professional.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.240
Are you implying
I have a lot of experience as well?

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.000
I used to do

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.890
a part-time job at a hair salon abroad.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.150
So, were you called

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.610
Tony Xiao back then?

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.450
Not that common name.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.820
I was called Kevin.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.670
Kevin?

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.060
Sounds like a chief hair stylist.
