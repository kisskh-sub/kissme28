WEBVTT

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.880
She won't believe it.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.240
No, I believe it.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.400
So you were pretending to be drunk.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.760
Of course.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.079
If I didn't do that,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.920
how could I see your true colors?

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.079
You really are the woman I like.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.799
You always manage to surprise me.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.760
Tell me, when did you start suspecting me?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.359
Don't you forget,

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.079
I'm no worse than you when it comes to surveillance tech.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.079
When you gave me this lucky star

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.159
back then,

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.120
I sensed something was off.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.480
Do you trust him that much?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.439
Before a pig-butchering scam makes the final cut,

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.960
the victim trusts them just like you do.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.639
Chu Chen is different.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.520
He knew my father a long time ago.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.599
Yet he pretended not to know him.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.680
He's quite the actor.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.439
Chu Chen worked at the research institute back then.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.680
Many people knew that.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.360
You weren't there, so you didn't know him.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520
I was the one who introduced him to the institute.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.080
So all those times you two argued over me...

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.080
it was all an act?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.159
Of course.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.639
If the acting isn't realistic enough,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.680
how could we fool a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.360
big liar with schemes as deep as the ocean like you?

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.840
You didn't really think

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.080
Lin Yun is still that little girl from ten years ago, did you?

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.080
I know you came back for The Firmament.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.719
We could have researched The Firmament together.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.680
But instead, you came back to steal the hard drive.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.400
That changes everything.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.240
Yun, I actually did it to protect you.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.039
Once The Firmament is cracked,

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.280
the mastermind behind the scenes will surely target you.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.280
For your safety,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.680
I had to take the hard drive first.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.199
You steal something,

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.240
and yet you make it sound so noble.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.879
I really admire you.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.639
Leave the hard drive and go.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.960
Come and get it.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.159
Huo Ming!

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.000
Huo Ming!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.080
Huo Ming, wake up!

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.199
Huo Ming!

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.680
Huo Ming!

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.400
Huo Ming!

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.719
You're nothing special after all.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.120
Huo Ming!

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.519
Huo Ming, wake up!

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.160
Huo Ming!

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.839
Master, wake up quickly.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.560
There is a violent energy reaction.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.959
That punch

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.879
is equivalent to the strength of fifty boxers.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.199
Unknown energy also detected.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.120
Master, he can crush you.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.680
Chu Chen's gauntlet is that powerful?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.279
The Firmament hard drive is still in his hands.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.240
Be careful, Huo Ming!

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.160
Jerk! Leave the hard drive!

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:46.800
Huo Ming, open the door!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.639
Huo Ming, open the door!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.439
Lin Yun, don't come out. It's dangerous!

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.079
Master, your power is being absorbed by him.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.720
His gauntlet also uses Super-Elastic Memory Alloy.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.920
You can't beat him.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.720
Now you realize the gap between us?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.160
Your AI Eye relies on Lin Yun to recharge.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.480
So my gauntlet

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.879
has a specially added Electromagnetic Interference Matrix.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.399
It can rapidly absorb your power.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.000
Huo Ming.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You are no match for me at all.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.360
Master, he has already invaded your brain.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.680
My power is low. I cannot resist the intrusion.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.879
That's enough for today.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.920
I have another surprise waiting for you.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.000
Huo Ming! Huo Ming!

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.680
Huo Ming!

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:57.759
Huo Ming!

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.519
Huo Ming, you're awake.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:18.639
Just now, why did you...

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.000
...lock me inside all alone?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Do you know how dangerous that is?

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.959
When that jerk grabbed me...

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.959
...guess what I remembered?

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.920
I remembered when we were kids.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.319
I was scared to death.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.680
Chu Chen is extremely vengeful.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.000
You have to be on guard.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.519
And another thing...

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.279
It's inconvenient for you to stay in a hotel alone.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.600
And I'm a bit scared living alone.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.000
Besides, your battery level...

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.360
Wait.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.519
You mean I should move back?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.279
So we can charge?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.439
Anyway, since I use my phone during the day...

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.920
...it can stay charging all night.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.399
Wait, wait.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.759
Let me get this straight.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.120
You mean...

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.519
The phone and the charger need to be together.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.360
It works best if they're in the same room.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.920
Preferably on the same sofa.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.879
How do you know so much?

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:34.480
Just say if you're moving or not.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.399
Moving. I'll move immediately.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.600
Not for anything else...

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.839
Mainly because Chu Chen is too sinister and cunning.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.800
He's too bad.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.079
That lousy gauntlet of his...

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:51.120
Chu Chen's gauntlet has an Electromagnetic Interference Matrix

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.079
No fear.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.000
The tech content of his gauntlet...

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.120
...is just average.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.920
Don't worry, I'll get the hard drive back for you in minutes.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.319
Lao Ding.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.480
Huo Ming, hand over the researcher's password.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll give you half an hour.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:16.000
If you don't come, Lao Ding is done for.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.680
Are you...

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.120
I'll go with you.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.279
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.279
I'll go with you.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.399
Okay.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.000
It's cold outside. Go change your clothes.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.559
Okay, wait for me.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.919
Lao Ding.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.919
The time to test the brotherhood...

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:46.960
...between you and Huo Ming has arrived.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.519
Xiao Cang.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.080
Is that person Lao Ding?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.879
Master.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:17.960
Based on body shape and other characteristics analysis...

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.679
...the match rate is 99%.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:20.399
It is Lao Ding.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.840
Why isn't there anyone guarding him?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.799
Something's not right.

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:23.519
Master.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:25.639
After a full-range non-contact scan...

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.519
...and multiple risk matrix analyses...

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.600
...no anomalies or dangers have been found for now.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.480
Forget it, let's save him first.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.200
Huo Ming.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.639
Boss.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.440
Is everything arranged?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.879
Don't worry, Boss.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.480
As soon as the rope is untied, the virus will be released.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.159
Let's go.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:14.720
Okay.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.080
Why is it so quiet?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.759
Did I save the wrong person?

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:23.840
Are you really Lao Ding?

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.080
If I'm not Lao Ding...

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.120
...am I a ghost?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.080
Let's go quickly.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.639
What's wrong with you?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.519
Lao Ding, you...

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.039
Did you see that just now?

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:45.120
There was a ghost like Sadako!

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.759
Is it like this?

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.879
My vital energy is so strong...

00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:58.960
...and my Fate is so tough...

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.799
...how could I see a ghost?

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.120
Xiao Cang.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.120
Xiao Cang, what happened just now?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.320
Did you detect any anomalies?
