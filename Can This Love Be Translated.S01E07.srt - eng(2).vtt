00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.286
- Where is he?
- Hey, Ho-jin.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.038
He's been crying for an hour.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:45.879
Jin-suk.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.173
Get up, will you?

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.216
Hey, Ho-jin.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.345
Why are you crying in public?
You're embarrassing yourself. Let's go.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.226
Guess what? Shin Ji-sun said
I broke up with her first.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.395
But I never did.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.691
She told me to think carefully,
but I swear I never did.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.612
Sure. Let's think about it at home.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.072
Come on. Up you go.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.783
I'm so angry and frustrated.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.242
When did I ever say that?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.328
I get it. Just walk straight.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.496
Okay. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.830
Walk straight.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.595
Jin-suk.

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.849
Have you sobered up a bit?
Shall I drive you home?

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:42.977
Here.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.730
I don't want it.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.696
Whenever I'd get drunk,
Ji-sun would come pick me up.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.794
What was that?

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.631
I'm just so heartbroken

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.635
that I'm sharing my sadness
with the world.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.223
Does that make you feel better?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.266
Yes.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.271
Expressing my emotions outwardly
makes me feel better.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.607
I bet people like you,

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.277
who bottle up their feelings
and deal with them alone,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.820
would never understand.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.030
You're right.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.866
I don't understand it.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.745
Because I'd be burdening others
with my emotions.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.709
I don't understand you either,
you cold-blooded jerk.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:55.466
Not expressing my feelings
doesn't mean they're not there.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.517
Or that they're easy to get over.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.660
Are you posting a photo?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.831
If you are, make sure
the brand-sponsored watch is in it.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.836
By the way, Mu-hee,
Nanami reached out to me.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.755
She and Hiro arrived in Korea today.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.548
Did she?

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.092
I guess he has work in Korea.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.845
She actually asked about your schedule.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.639
Maybe he's here to see you.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.432
Me? Why?

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.018
Didn't you say you met Hiro on the plane?

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:48.811
Are you sure nothing happened?

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.190
Right.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.484
I did see him…

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.197
but I was so out of sorts then.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.242
I crashed after a glass of wine.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.078
Maybe you slipped up while you were drunk.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.581
You were chasing Ho-jin around
like a madwoman

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.542
until you totally lost it.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.378
You're right.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.381
I ran after him like a madwoman

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.424
and sealed the deal.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.679
Well, if your fate is sealed,

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:27.100
can you stop posting cloudy skies
and raindrops that look like tears?

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.811
It's obvious who you posted these for,

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.938
but he's not the type
to look at that stuff.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:35.942
Have you

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.862
met Mr. Joo Ho-jin since then?

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.327
I haven't seen him, but we've talked.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.037
On the phone and by text.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.414
About what?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.499
Well, you know…

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.878
Hey, wait. You can't just check my phone.

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:00.633
You even memorized my lock pattern?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.927
What… what is this?

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.179
You're moving?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.184
I'm moving into Ho-jin's house.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.937
We discussed it in Canada.

00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:16.232
I told him
my housing contract fell through.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.986
He agreed to let me stay at his place
for a few months.

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.905
Why didn't you tell me about this?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.533
Because I figured
you'd react just like this.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.703
You'd be pressing me for details
on how he is and what he's doing.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.122
We'll be filming soon,

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.499
and, like it or not,
you'll see each other.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.501
How can you work together like this?

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.718
I'm going to tonight's event alone.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.677
Don't follow me.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:45.595
Alone?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.223
But it's a concert
sponsored by an advertiser.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.975
I should be there to introduce you.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.770
You said you didn't want me
pressing you for details.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.147
Leave before I bite your head off.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.690
Fine. I won't come.

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:00.860
But text me once you get there.

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.288
I'm laid out, all damp like wet laundry…

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.543
but he's nice and dry,

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.714
put back together neatly.

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:28.179
Are you sure Do Ra-mi was wrong
and that you won?

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.059
No.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.561
I lost.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.188
Run away!

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.026
I shouldn't have listened to her…

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:46.406
and run away.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.476
Hey, cut it out already.
At this rate, I'll pop out.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.105
Why blame me
when you're the one who ran away?

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.867
Jin-suk, where are you?
Are you running late?

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.287
Mr. Kim's here,
and Mr. Oh from the publishing company.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.746
I'm sorry. I can't go.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.165
Come. Let's take a picture.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:39.667
What?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.337
You called us here tonight.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:47.592
You begged, saying it'd lift your mood
and that you had the invitations.

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.887
And you're the one who invited
Mr. Kim and Mr. Oh as an apology.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.804
So why…

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:54.932
can't you come?

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.602
I'm at the airport.

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:59.145
I'm headed to Santiago.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.105
What?

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.273
Ji-sun was right.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.276
I did break up with her first.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:07.570
JIN-SUK & JI-SUN

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.158
OUR STORY WILL BEGIN
UNDER THE CLEAR SKIES OF JEJU

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.784
AS WE SET OFF ON A NEW JOURNEY TOGETHER…

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.871
So the invitations are as you wanted.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.749
What else shall we do?
Tell me all your wedding wishes.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.420
This is all so sudden that I'm not sure
we could make anything happen.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.671
Come on now.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.508
You insisted on getting married quickly.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.928
Still, I'm not sure
we should rush things like this.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.181
Let's just get it over and done with.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:40.311
If we don't tie the knot right now,
I don't think I'll ever want to.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.783
Why do you want to get married?

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:54.825
Why?

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.577
You said you wanted to.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.972
I was a coward,

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.140
and I'm ashamed.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.727
So I'm leaving

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.857
to do some self-reflection and penance.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.904
Have a safe trip.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.158
Don't cry in public,
and don't get drunk and start yelling.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:37.827
Okay.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.538
My dear younger brother Ho-jin.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.165
You could do more of that yourself.

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:44.792
Do what?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:48.254
The vinyl record. Why'd you stare at it
with such a sad look in your eyes?

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:53.634
See you.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.803
I hope you have a rough time.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.735
- Good evening.
- Hello.

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:13.571
Goodness, how are you? It's been so long.

00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:14.488
How are you?

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.282
Good, very good!

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.080
How come your manager isn't with you?

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.708
- He had other business to attend to.
- I see.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:30.379
The Italian ambassador is here today.
Would you like to say hello after?

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.505
That'd be an honor.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.299
Okay. I'll arrange a meeting.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:34.508
Thank you.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.261
Ho-jin, we have a situation.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.138
Could you please help us out?

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.514
Sure. What is it?

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.392
Don't. I invited him here as a guest.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.436
It'd be impolite to ask.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:50.775
We don't have an interpreter,
so I'm unable to greet the theater staff.

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.109
They'll arrive soon enough.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.904
- They're at Chungmu-ro.
- How far can it be?

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.906
Chungmu-ro is over an hour away!

00:10:56.989 --> 00:11:01.243
You've been the ambassador for how long?
Yet you still don't know Seoul geography?

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.873
Isn't there anyone from the embassy
who can interpret for you?

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:09.960
I don't think they'll make it in time
with the traffic and all.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:16.300
Then would you like me to help?

00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:18.094
That'd be lovely.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.554
That would be fantastic.

00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:22.640
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:27.645
I prepared some opening remarks
for the concert.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:29.605
Could you just help with those?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.818
I'll just let the people I came with know,
and then I'll get ready.

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.444
Of course. Thanks a lot.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.655
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.921
- Do you come here often?
- Me? No.

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.923
- No?
- What about you?

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:57.425
It's my first time.

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.557
Unbelievable.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:12.523
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.726
The rascal's not coming.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.034
Apparently, the ambassador
and his wife are also fans of Do Ra-mi.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.412
- When I greet them…
- Yes?

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.956
…an interpreter will be present, right?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.249
Yes, of course.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:14.710
There they are.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.504
Hello.

00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:26.806
This is Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:38.859
Nice to meet you.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.653
Thank you for coming.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.947
I'm a big fan of Do Ra-mi's.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.119
Thank you for inviting me.

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:56.085
Mu-hee, you must be exhausted.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:57.461
Oh dear.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:02.466
You can skip the embassy bazaar
that the ambassador's wife invited you to.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.471
He was a different interpreter, right?

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.722
Sorry?

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:12.852
Wasn't there a different interpreter
at the start of the concert?

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.021
Well, I'm not sure.

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.899
Was I seeing things again?

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.152
Hey, Joo Ho-jin!

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.782
Where might you be, Joo Ho-jin?

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.618
Something came up,
so I couldn't go to my seat.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:33.497
I'm in the parking lot.
Could you ride with Mr. Oh to my place?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.541
No, Mr. Oh already left.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.002
Wait for me, Joo Ho-jin.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.796
There it is.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.759
I'll be going, then.

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:47.303
Wait, Mu-hee?

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.554
Going down.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.890
Doors closing.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.391
Well, take care.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:54.727
Which floor?

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:00.566
I'm going to the same floor as you.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:01.525
Thank you.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.776
Don't mention it.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.113
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, right?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.576
- You know me?
- Of course I do.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:12.578
Why, you're a famous actress.

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:17.082
I was sitting next to you
in the concert hall earlier.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.919
Next to that empty seat.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.046
I see.

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:23.172
Yes.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.132
And I heard what you just said.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.009
You were right.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.346
It's not the same interpreter.

00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:31.805
Sorry?

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.267
I know the guy
who was interpreting at the beginning.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.853
The empty seat between us

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.523
was actually his seat.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.652
And that guy is, well…

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.028
Doors opening.

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:51.158
It's that guy there.

00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:52.910
Joo Ho-jin.

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.372
What took you so long?

00:15:56.914 --> 00:16:01.585
We'd planned for a dinner of four here,
but two people canceled.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:05.047
If someone as distinguished as you
joins us, all the better.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.717
Still, the owner of the house
didn't invite me, so…

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.720
Well, this house is practically mine.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.222
It's only his on paper.

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:14.932
It's okay.

00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:19.812
I must say, I am pretty hungry.
I'll take the free meal, then.

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:20.896
Marvelous.

00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.774
Don't pay that guy any mind.

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:26.819
Just think of him as a manservant
who works at this house.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.325
Please come in.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:38.539
This place will impress you.
Just look at it.

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:43.043
The person who built this house
traveled all over the world

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.380
collecting old art,
classical books, antiques,

00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:49.466
and even the vinyl records over there.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.470
This house is as good as a museum.

00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:56.348
You mean
Ho-jin's maternal grandfather, don't you?

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.266
Yeah.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.518
Wait, you knew that?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.687
Have you been here before?

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.024
Once, just briefly.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.316
I see.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.194
Well then, you'll feel right at home.

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:13.699
Why are you standing around?
Get on it and make us dinner.

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:16.577
Any preferences, Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.662
I'm not too picky,

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.581
but I do love spicy food.

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:21.957
Spicy food?

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.835
Did you get that?
Anything spicy on the menu?

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:27.254
Jin-suk chose tonight's menu,
and it's Japanese.

00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:29.339
Japanese? Forget that.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.051
Just do a spicy braised monkfish
or stir-fried octopus.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.136
- How does that sound?
- Sounds great.

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.262
That works, right?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:37.139
No, I don't have monkfish or octopus.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.307
- Any blue crab?
- None.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.266
- Cod?
- Nope.

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:40.476
Squid, then?

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.435
- I don't--
- You do!

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:42.352
- You do!
- I don't.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.605
Then stir-fried squid it is.
Make it spicy.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.399
- How does that sound?
- Sounds great.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.956
He's even a good cook, you know.

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:06.543
- I know.
- My, my, you know everything!

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.504
You're a match made in… One moment.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.215
Excuse me. I should get this.

00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:14.093
Yes, Mr. Oh?

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.582
Mr. Oh, don't come here. Go back.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:49.378
I'm almost there.
I even brought Jeong, like you asked.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.463
Just turn around! Don't come here.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.984
Mr. Joo, can I help with anything?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.490
Should I chop this up?

00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:21.785
Go sit down. You're Mr. Kim's guest.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.503
Why are you even here anyway?

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.632
Mr. Kim asked me to come,

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.093
so I'm here for dinner.

00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:41.430
I'm just so hungry.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.432
Is that right?

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.267
Sure. Let's say you're really hungry.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.146
Though, by my logic,
you'd have to be starving to be here.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.611
Oh my!

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.238
What's this?

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.282
It looks delicious.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.827
It's just kelp broth.
I haven't even started cooking.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.287
So it is.

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:08.457
Just like us.

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:14.379
We're like broth with nothing but kelp.
Not even started yet.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.555
Stop hovering here and go sit down.
I'll feed you.

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:28.894
You turned it off?

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:31.480
Because I need to let it cool.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.357
It's for seasoning.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.945
Mr. Joo Ho-jin?

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:40.447
I get that

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.326
I kept sneaking little sips of kelp broth

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:47.412
and turned off the heat prematurely.

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:52.668
But can't we let it boil a little longer
instead of letting it cool?

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.421
It'd be a waste to stop
after just a taste.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.299
It would be a shame, wouldn't it?

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:05.639
I think I turned it off
and left it to cool at the perfect time.

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:07.975
It's not a waste nor a shame.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.520
I mean, it's just water with kelp.
There's nothing to it, really.

00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:16.942
That's not true.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:19.820
I did

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:22.781
kiss you once!

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:33.959
I was going to fry this.

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.886
The concert must be over by now.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.055
Should I try contacting Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.224
No. There's no need.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.936
Once she finds out I'm in Seoul,
she'll get in touch.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.357
Why not just reach out to her first?
You did come all this way to see her.

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.444
Nanami, I didn't come here
to meet that zombie.

00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:01.945
I came to take photographs.

00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:04.865
Look.
Aren't the fall night lights beautiful?

00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.243
You can take pictures of fall scenery
anywhere in Japan.

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.078
It's different.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.456
The cityscape is completely different.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.958
- You can see it through the camera.
- Sure.

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:17.544
So you won't meet Ms. Cha Mu-hee
before you leave?

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.757
If she contacts me,

00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:25.135
I guess I could see her while I'm here.

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.314
It's spicy and delicious.
Man, you're good.

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:39.316
You should've gone on Culinary Class Wars.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.862
I went on that family trip to Canada, too,
back when he was young.

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:46.865
So I guess you really are like family.

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:48.283
There's no doubt about it.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:51.161
Did you visit that park
we went to back then?

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:53.789
- That's where they were filming.
- Is that so?

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.917
Then did you visit
where we saw the double rainbow?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.168
That waterfall.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.966
I wanted to, but I couldn't find it.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.762
That's too bad.
It was such a splendid waterfall.

00:23:11.973 --> 00:23:13.892
A waterfall only you and I know about.

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.145
The waterfall is nice and cool.

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:37.207
The waterfall we saw together

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.501
was pretty too.

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:43.380
It wasn't a waterfall.

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.426
But we agreed to call it one.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:52.264
I'm done humoring your claim
that all falling water is a waterfall.

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.106
Hey.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.525
About the concert.

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:07.696
Did you come to interpret
because you knew I was coming?

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:12.617
What are you thinking?

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.996
Why would I go there to interpret,
knowing you'd be there?

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:19.040
You did that once before to meet me.

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:20.542
The answer is no.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.550
Then why didn't you come sit?

00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:32.721
I thought it'd be awkward.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.557
Then why did you agree
to let Yong-u move in?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.100
If he's here, I'll come by often.

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:40.437
According to Yong-u,
you've never been to his place,

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:42.772
so you'd never show up here.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.691
That's true.

00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.110
Fine.

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:52.657
So you came here
with those mistaken assumptions?

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.242
With such confidence?

00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:58.914
I need that confidence
to be able to sway you again.

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.665
You see,

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.126
rather than walk away with dignity,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.712
I've decided to be the crazy bitch
who sways you.

00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:07.088
Because…

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:13.929
I'm placing my hope in the last thing
you said to me that day.

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.313
You said you were going to cross.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.485
So…

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.406
we did see a waterfall together!

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:09.526
I ought to visit a place like that
at least once before I die.

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:11.570
You have though.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.157
One of our drones fell into a ravine,
and you and I fished it out. Remember?

00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.369
Oh yeah, we did.

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:22.372
That was so rough.
I said I'd never go back.

00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:23.915
But it looks great like this.

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:27.002
That's why they say
it's a comedy from afar

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:29.504
but a tragedy from up close.

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:33.550
The real tragedy is all the footage
we haven't even started reviewing yet.

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.261
My eyes are watering
like they're about to pop out.

00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:38.597
Don't cry.

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:42.142
Yong-u, thanks
for always bringing the snacks.

00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:44.686
Mu-hee looks great, so don't you worry.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.980
Thank you. And hang in there!

00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:49.399
- I'll clean up before I leave.
- You don't need to.

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:52.527
We should save some macarons
for Producer Shin.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.613
Looks like another all-nighter for her.

00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:57.449
Starting tomorrow,
she should be free during the day.

00:26:57.532 --> 00:26:59.200
Her fiancé went to Spain.

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.786
Spain? The writer Na Jin-suk?

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:05.373
Yeah, he posted on Instagram
that he's going to Spain. Santiago.

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:06.750
I'm so freaking jealous.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:09.461
Well, we're going to Italy.

00:27:09.544 --> 00:27:11.671
We're going for work. Not to have fun.

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:30.565
NA JIN-SUK
#SPAIN #SANTIAGO #CAMINO

00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:08.269
Wow.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.772
So she really is going around
trying to cheat.

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:15.527
Hello, sir.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.904
- To Yeonnam-dong, please.
- Sure.

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:25.578
Yes, Mr. Ahn.

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:27.580
I swung by the cutting room.

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:29.124
Of course!

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.544
- They say the Canada footage looks great.
- Yong-u.

00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:34.754
- They were singing her praises.
- My bag, Yong-u!

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:38.717
Italy has a totally different vibe
from Canada,

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.510
so it should feel fresh.

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:45.348
Sorry. I was on the phone with my boss,
so I couldn't answer your call.

00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:47.308
It's fine.

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.561
Is that for working late?

00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:54.607
Those clothes.

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.986
I meant, are those clothes
for you to wear while editing?

00:28:58.945 --> 00:29:00.447
Not "work late" as in cheating.

00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:03.408
Sure.

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.535
Both outfits are for working late.

00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:07.620
Right.

00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:09.497
Editing and cheating.

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:12.125
You must be busy keeping up with both.

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.753
Did you hurt yourself?

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:30.143
ATFL tears can be quite serious.

00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:34.522
An "ATFL tear"?

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.775
I told you I was an athlete.

00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:40.236
It'll feel a bit better if you tape it.
Shall I do it for you?

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:01.549
Are you okay?

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.884
What?

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:04.427
Right.

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:06.387
I couldn't tell earlier,

00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:08.556
but it's starting to hurt.

00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:11.100
Let me see.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.541
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:55.520
Is an ATFL tear
something I should be worried about?

00:30:57.272 --> 00:30:59.607
It's just a fancy term
for a sprained ankle.

00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:01.693
Otherwise, you would've limped off.

00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:10.410
You said you were an athlete, didn't you?
Which sport?

00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:13.246
- Shooting.
- Did you do it for long?

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:18.626
I did it until I was conscripted.
An injury ended my career.

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:22.338
After the army,
my mom got me a job at her brother's firm.

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.676
Your mom's brother's company?

00:31:28.177 --> 00:31:30.221
Then the CEO of your company is…

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:33.349
Yes. CEO Ahn is my uncle.

00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:35.560
So you were family.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.228
That explains it.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.982
I wondered why a fresh-faced rookie
was working with Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:43.610
I might've gotten the job
through nepotism,

00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:46.279
but I've been with Mu-hee
since she was a nobody.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:50.617
I cried with her, clutching her script
after every failed audition.

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:55.496
Sorry. I take back calling you
a fresh-faced rookie.

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:59.375
In that case, take back what you said
about planning to cheat too.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.464
Now that I know what I know,
it really bothers me whenever I see you.

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.595
Were you keeping me occupied
to stop me from cheating?

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.847
While going on about ATFL or whatever?

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:13.890
That

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:17.435
was because I knew you were hurt today.

00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:20.438
I wish I didn't know, but I do.

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:22.607
I heard he flew out today.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.074
You said you'd cheat so you couldn't
go back to him, didn't you?

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:35.536
If you're struggling to move on,
why not just take him back?

00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:39.874
You're so out of it that you lost your bag
and sprained your ankle.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.629
You didn't even get to cheat, and tonight,
you'll be in the cutting room all night.

00:32:45.838 --> 00:32:47.090
Honestly, it's quite sad.

00:32:49.008 --> 00:32:50.510
Are you that worried about me?

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.389
Then will you help me?

00:32:56.224 --> 00:32:58.059
You're clearly interested in me.

00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.852
After I said I'd cheat,

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:02.355
haven't you been hanging around,
hoping for a shot?

00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:10.321
Okay, then. What if I agree to help?
What will you do about it?

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.449
I'm a joke to you, aren't I?

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:16.494
It's not that you're a joke.
I'm saying you can't do this.

00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:17.412
Why not?

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:25.044
When a shooting athlete aims at a target,
it needs to be done with sincerity.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:34.679
"I'll hit the target no matter what.
If I miss, I'll be the one who gets shot."

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.015
But

00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.643
you don't have that sincerity.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.231
That's why when it's time to fire,
you hesitate and can't pull the trigger.

00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:11.799
Thanks for your help.

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.558
You pulled the trigger.

00:34:55.384 --> 00:34:56.844
Should I just contact Ms. Cha?

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.137
Don't!

00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:00.598
No matter what, don't contact her first!

00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:04.393
I'm not meeting that zombie
until she asks to see me.

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:07.313
Sure.

00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:14.987
Cha Mu-hee.

00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.615
Why isn't she calling me?

00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:22.328
After what she did to me
on the plane that day…

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:25.915
You seem okay.

00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:40.680
Hiro, it's too cold out.

00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:58.781
Shall we eat too?

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:00.825
It'd warm us up.

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.327
No, thanks.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.338
Ms. Cha Mu-hee

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.591
has not reached out.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.974
Let's go back to the hotel.

00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:32.523
TO CEO OH SEONG-CHEOL

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:35.067
TO CHA MU-HEE,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.534
Here.

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:47.538
Next time, I'll give you Do Ra-mi merch
with proper autographs.

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.040
Oh, that would be great.

00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:50.708
Here. This is my book.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.126
Thank you.

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:55.213
This is my first time meeting a novelist.

00:36:55.296 --> 00:36:56.422
No, it isn't.

00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:58.925
You've met him.

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.510
You mean Mr. Joo Ho-jin?

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:05.181
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, you wrote a book?

00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:07.308
Just once, in college.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:11.938
But it won a prize
and even became a bestseller.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.233
What's the title? I'd like to buy a copy.

00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:17.026
You can't get it. It's out of print.

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:18.611
I have a few copies.

00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:20.947
Come by my studio sometime.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.615
- I'll give you one.
- Thank you.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.953
Can I post a photo on Instagram
of this book you signed?

00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:29.330
I'd be so grateful if you did.

00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:33.417
I follow you on Instagram.
Should we follow each other?

00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:36.170
I would really love to,

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:39.006
but if we do,
your account could get a lot of heat.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.883
Is that so?

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:44.595
So you and Ho-jin don't follow each other?

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:46.389
Mr. Joo Ho-jin doesn't follow me.

00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:47.765
Sure, he does.

00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:51.060
Right?

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.312
Ho-jin, you follow her, don't you?

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.815
I saw it on your account.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.653
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, you're following me?

00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:02.780
We made that bet

00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:04.657
back in Japan.

00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:06.909
I followed you, as promised.

00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.995
See?

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.164
I see.

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.252
I had no idea.

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:18.587
Wait, you didn't know that?

00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:21.132
I have quite a few followers, so…

00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.681
Oh boy, Joo Ho-jin!

00:38:28.764 --> 00:38:30.391
You were just one of many!

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.770
Look. I'm sorry.

00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:37.481
As we promised that day,
I should follow you back,

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:38.983
but it'd be a little--

00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:40.776
You don't have to. Please don't.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.696
You should've accepted
when she first offered.

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:48.576
If the two of you are done with your tea,
you should go.

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.661
No, I haven't finished my tea yet.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.288
Mu-hee, take your time with that.

00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.248
Mr. Kim, the time is…

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.416
The time?

00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:59.587
This is the time?
It's almost time for my show to air.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.548
- Divorce Your Husband.
- You watch that too, Mr. Kim?

00:39:02.631 --> 00:39:06.344
Goodness, of course! It's excellent.
I always bawl my eyes out.

00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.929
- Exactly.
- Why don't we watch some TV together?

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.389
- Shall we?
- Let's.

00:39:11.223 --> 00:39:13.517
Wait. Where did I put my glasses?

00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:16.145
I think I left them in your car earlier.

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:31.786
You seem to be enjoying yourself,
but you should call it a day and go home.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:34.830
Yeah?

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:39.502
Then, since I'm out here anyway,
I'll get going.

00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:44.590
Head on in. Don't leave her all alone.

00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:45.508
Mr. Kim.

00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:48.928
You left your seat empty earlier
to avoid her, didn't you?

00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:53.933
Do you find that young lady hard to read?

00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:04.110
You once told me that every person
speaks their own language.

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:05.736
I did.

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:09.740
I don't think
I understand her language very well.

00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:16.997
I approached thinking she was interested,
but she turned me down.

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.501
I avoided her, taking that as rejection,

00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.170
but now she's here, acting like that.

00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:28.926
Is she interested in me again,
or does she feel bad for turning me down?

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.637
I can't really tell.

00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:41.605
I have no idea what to say to her
once I'm inside.

00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.901
It must be frustrating
not being able to understand her.

00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:47.987
But

00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:52.700
are you fine with not understanding her?
Aren't you an interpreter?

00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:57.371
If it's a language you don't know,
you should study it.

00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.248
The vocabulary, syntax,

00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:03.085
and punctuation will all differ
from those of the language you speak.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:09.133
Look closely
and try your best to understand.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.505
The weather is lovely.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.552
Isn't the song lovely too?

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.645
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:11.023
I'm going to head off now.

00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:13.776
Where's Mr. Kim?

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:14.735
He left.

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.987
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:21.909
Thanks so much for dinner.
It was delicious.

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:22.951
I'll be going.

00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:24.370
One second.

00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:29.958
We need to talk.

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:36.465
Why are you so jittery?

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:47.726
What is that?

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:50.396
That.

00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:54.274
What? It's the book
Mr. Kim gave me earlier. Why?

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:55.776
Something's up. Let me see.

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.777
What? This is mine.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.821
- You're clearly hiding something.
- What?

00:44:58.904 --> 00:44:59.780
- Let's see.
- What?

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:00.948
What's that over there?

00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:11.959
Wow.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.339
Okay, I stole it.
How'd you even see that, Eagle Eyes?

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.968
I looked closely
with the intention of studying

00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:23.387
and caught a thief.

00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.521
You really have a knack…

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.984
for driving me insane.

00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:42.114
If you're not going to turn me in,
can I have my book back?

00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:43.907
I'm embarrassed and just want to go.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.094
You're giving me this?

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.180
It was always yours.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.559
I bought it as a gift for you.

00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:15.314
I didn't think I'd get to give it to you,
but here you are, stealing it yourself.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:21.945
Thank you.

00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:25.616
For dinner and the gift.

00:46:26.658 --> 00:46:29.369
I should repay you
for what you've given me.

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:34.166
I'll treat you to a delicious meal
and give you a gift next time.

00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:35.876
Next time?

00:46:41.006 --> 00:46:41.882
Yong-u!

00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:44.635
You said Yong-u's moving in here.

00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:46.386
At the housewarming,

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.306
I'll bring some good food and a gift.

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:52.226
Then see you next time.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.109
Next time?

00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:18.919
She left this behind.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.730
Oh no. I only brought the sleeve.

00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:44.611
Am I an idiot?

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:54.454
PAPAGO♥

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.424
You took the sleeve
and left the record behind.

00:48:05.924 --> 00:48:07.593
Will you steal this next time?

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:11.013
I forgot because I was in a rush to leave.

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.807
It may be hard to believe,

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:16.351
but I didn't leave it behind
on purpose this time.

00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:17.644
How far did you get?

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:22.357
I'm almost home.

00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:25.235
Then wait in front of your place.
I'll bring it to you.

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.529
Sorry? What?

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.114
Now?

00:48:29.197 --> 00:48:30.282
Yes.

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.075
Send me your address.

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:34.745
I'll head over there now.

00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:39.458
You don't have to go out of your way
to come here.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.461
I'm already in my car. Should I get out?

00:48:42.544 --> 00:48:45.756
No. If you're in your car anyway,
you might as well come.

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:47.174
I'm coming. Wait for me.

00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:04.001
Mu-hee?

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:26.648
Your uncle is here.

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.595
PAPAGO♥

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.737
Your call cannot be completed.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.325
You will be forwarded to voicemail
and charged after the beep.

00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:27.334
Your call cannot be completed.

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.712
You will be forwarded to voicemail
and charged after the beep.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:47.687
JOO HO-JIN

00:51:51.399 --> 00:51:52.400
Hey, Mr. Joo.

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:54.986
Why is it so hard to reach you?

00:51:55.737 --> 00:51:58.907
Oh, things were so hectic
that I didn't notice my phone was dead.

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.784
Have you been calling? I'm sorry.

00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:04.121
I think something's up with Ms. Cha.
I can't reach her.

00:52:04.204 --> 00:52:05.664
Mu-hee?

00:52:06.581 --> 00:52:08.083
She's at a photo shoot right now.

00:52:09.584 --> 00:52:11.753
- What?
- She's getting her hair and makeup done.

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.048
Wanna talk to her?

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:19.177
No. As long as she's okay, it's fine.

00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:22.222
Actually, an article was published today.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:25.725
It covers a touchy subject for her,
so I guess she didn't answer.

00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:28.019
But don't worry.

00:52:29.437 --> 00:52:30.897
She's still her cheerful self.

00:52:33.066 --> 00:52:33.984
She is?

00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:53.420
PAPAGO♥

00:53:07.934 --> 00:53:11.313
I knew things were tense with your family,
but that article was a surprise.

00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:14.733
Reporters showed up at my uncle's house.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:20.405
I'm under his family register.
I guess they thought they were my parents.

00:53:20.488 --> 00:53:22.115
THE GLAMOROUS FAMILY HISTORY
OF AN ACTRESS BORN INTO WEALTH

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.160
But the article is in your favor.
Claims you were born into wealth.

00:53:25.243 --> 00:53:28.872
These days, being bold and fabulous works.
Everyone loves you even more.

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.374
Cha Mu-hee is loved.

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.335
Is that right?

00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:37.714
That's good.

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:45.472
By the way, Ho-jin called.

00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:48.058
He was worried that he couldn't reach you.

00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:49.726
Did the two of you plan to meet up?

00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:53.855
I wanted to…

00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:57.317
but I won't be seeing him.

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.653
I stood him up.

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.377
Do you really

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:01.965
not remember what happened
to your mom and dad?

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.063
No smiling!

00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:19.899
You disgust me.

00:55:53.558 --> 00:55:54.392
That's me.

00:55:57.145 --> 00:55:59.230
That picture was taken on my birthday.

00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:02.692
That's my house.

00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:05.653
The flowers I grew

00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:07.489
and my chicks.

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.784
Dad came home
for the first time in a while

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:13.828
with a birthday present for me.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.999
Mu-hee!

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:20.794
- Happy birthday to you
- Daddy!

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:23.421
- Happy birthday to you
- A teddy bear? I love it!

00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:25.006
- Happy birthday!
- It's so cute.

00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:28.635
You're the best, Dad!

00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:43.066
Eat up.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.901
You're so cute.

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.180
Mom?

00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:48.256
Serves you right, you liar.

00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:54.387
You sneaky devil.

00:57:54.888 --> 00:57:57.724
You lied,
pretending you didn't remember a thing,

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.726
and now you're scared you'll get caught.

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:05.523
You felt uneasy, didn't you?

00:58:06.232 --> 00:58:08.109
When people started loving
the likes of you.

00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:10.361
You don't believe it, do you?

00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:12.280
That they'll keep loving you.

00:58:17.535 --> 00:58:19.496
I only emerged because you're so pathetic.

00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:27.045
Leave it all to me.
After all, everyone loves Do Ra-mi.

00:58:50.902 --> 00:58:53.071
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, shall we begin?

00:58:53.154 --> 00:58:54.030
Sure.

00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:05.583
She still hasn't reached out.
What should I do?

00:59:10.004 --> 00:59:10.964
Just call her.

00:59:11.464 --> 00:59:12.674
And set up a meeting.

00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:16.886
I debated leaving,
but I'm just too curious.

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.764
Let's do this!

00:59:21.432 --> 00:59:22.934
I'm curious too.

00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:23.851
About what?

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.772
What happened between you
and Ms. Cha Mu-hee on the plane?

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.201
I choose you.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:15.737
What are you doing?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.993
I'm watching the Do Ra-mi movie
to get some footage of Mu-hee.

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.496
But this… I'm watching it again,
and it's still terrifying.

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.666
Of course it is.
She's a zombie. A killer zombie.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.962
Yeah, she kills way too many people.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.799
But Do Ra-mi herself
only kills one person.

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.178
The man she loved.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.014
Mr. Kim?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.018
Mr. Kim, is that you?

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:04.721
Ma'am?

01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:13.479
Today's not the day you usually come

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:16.107
to clean.

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:30.621
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.374
What are you doing here?

01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:40.757
If I tell you to wait,

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:44.051
wait in the spot I told you to wait
until I show up.

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.852
I don't know
what vibe you're going for today,

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.105
but I won't be humoring you anymore.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:57.523
Please leave.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:02.153
Vibe? I like that kind of thing.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:07.658
Yesterday's vibe was "beggar thief."
What do I seem like today?

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:09.702
Have a guess.

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:12.955
Are you unwell?

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.001
See? You're so kind.

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:18.252
I wasn't being kind.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.839
No, you're kind.
That's why she's pining for you.

01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:33.351
"I felt like I might die
if someone was kind to me."

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:38.481
"It felt like kindness might kill me."

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:49.325
Not me though.

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.620
I…

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.713
simply kill.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.468
And who exactly

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.263
are you?

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.685
Today's vibe…

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.230
is Do Ra-mi.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.660
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:57.972
