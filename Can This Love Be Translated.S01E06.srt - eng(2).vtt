00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.108
Auroras are the light created when Earth,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.318
forever unable to reach the Sun,

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.033
draws in minute traces of solar plasma
with the pull of its magnetic field.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.709
Perhaps this dazzling, mesmerizing light

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.172
is but a tragic, fleeting illusion

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.008
born from the Earth's yearning
for the Sun,

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.844
fooling it into believing
that a mere brush with the Sun

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.014
has brought the two closer.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.867
On that night,

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.204
for the first time ever,

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.582
I desperately hoped
my delusion would become a reality.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.713
But Earth can never reach the Sun,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.842
and auroras do not appear
in the skies above Seoul.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.444
Mr. Joo Ho-jin,

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.321
let's head back now.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.616
We can stay and watch until it disappears.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.578
That's all right.
I don't want to watch it disappear.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.917
We saw it together, as promised.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:07.752
That's good enough.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.190
It's gone.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.696
I thought I told you to head inside.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.490
Did my threat to kill you earlier
freak you out?

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.826
It did at first,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.121
but I'm waiting here now
to find out why it ever happened.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.291
All you need to do is act
like you didn't hear what you heard.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.168
That's all?

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.003
But I'm an awful liar.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.508
I just don't want anyone to know
that the wedding's off.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.428
Well, everyone will find out soon enough.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.307
Fancy a fight?

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.643
Excuse me. You're the one
who started it with your death threat.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.234
You're not scared of my threat.
You're having a blast teasing me.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.738
I used to be an athlete,
so I have great reflexes.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.823
This phone isn't dead either.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.283
He's calling again.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.244
Take it
before I accidentally answer again.

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.083
Did he cheat on you?

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.588
Seems like the guy's begging you
to take him back, but don't.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.257
There's no going back from cheating.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.344
Is that right?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.180
Is there no going back if someone cheats?

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.437
Jin-suk. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.773
I can't marry you.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.233
I cheated on you.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.653
So don't ever call me again.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.488
We're over.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.036
You are the one… who cheated?

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.829
I'm going to start right now.

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:08.373
Cheating.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.425
It's stuck, isn't it?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.219
This has happened to me before

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:22.971
with old hotels in Europe.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.808
If you keep twisting,
the lock will pop open.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.062
You must be tired.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.731
Today's shoot ran a bit long.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.900
I get puffy when I'm tired.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.486
I guess today's shoot was a tough one.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.154
A bit.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:45.827
It was cold, no sign of the aurora,
and just awkward silence between us.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.871
So we just stoked the fire
and roasted things.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.416
We roasted potatoes and marshmallows.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.002
I'm still full from eating it all myself.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.380
Why'd you eat all of it by yourself?
Was he being prickly again?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.965
No.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.385
Hiro's watching what he eats
because he gains weight easily.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.846
Nanami gave me a little heads-up.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:06.764
Right.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.350
She also said that Hiro's been cranky

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:13.855
because he's sensitive to the cold,
has dry eyes, and all sorts of allergies.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.983
When we were holding hands,
I noticed they were ice-cold.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.901
Maybe he has poor circulation.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.904
You held hands with…

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.743
Why won't this thing open?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.870
So I'm going to look out for him
from now on.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:34.042
That's why I ate
all the marshmallows today.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.586
He smiled, so I guess he was grateful.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.757
I think I get why they call him
the Prince of Romance now.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.384
He's pretty cute when he smiles.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.803
Why won't this darn thing open?

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:49.640
- Is it stuck?
- Just leave it to me.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.727
And he has these dimples when he smiles.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.979
Where?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.150
If you look closely, right here.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.405
Can you really call it a dimple
if you have to look closely to spot it?

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.786
Why won't this open?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.412
Did someone jam it on purpose?

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.127
It's open!

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.879
Thank goodness!

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.548
I banged my head…

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.135
- You should go inside and rest.
- Thank you.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:27.887
By the way,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.474
Hiro says his favorite Korean food
is japchae with lots of mushrooms.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:33.851
Can you teach me how to make it?

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.520
I don't know how.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.063
I thought you were a good cook.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.272
I've never made it.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.443
- I'll just look it up on YouTube.
- Look it up. Sure.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.654
Go on in and rest. What was it again?

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.114
Earlier, you said…

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.741
Marshmallows. You said you ate a lot.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.284
Your face is all puffy.

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.878
So who will you cheat on him with?

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.801
Any unmarried guy
over the age of 20 would be fine.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.139
How would that be fine?
That could be anyone.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.766
I'm not looking for someone
I'd actually fall for.

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:17.812
So if you're not looking
for a good guy to move on with,

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.439
why must you cheat?

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.899
Because it has to be irreversible.

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:25.236
That way, I won't be able
to go back to him no matter what.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.491
Still, you can't just do that with anyone.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.870
Not only would it be dangerous,
but it would also be depraved!

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.124
So what? Should it be with someone I know?

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.626
To be safe and dignified?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.213
Someone you know? Who?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.965
Wait a minute.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.634
You don't mean Ho-jin, do you?

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.428
Do you?

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.474
Sure, you seem to have lost your marbles,
but you're not that far gone, are you?

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.856
I can't with him.

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.816
He doesn't meet the criteria.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:05.902
The criteria?

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:09.614
I told you it can't be someone
I might really fall for.

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.407
Which means

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.202
it can't be someone I once liked either.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.039
There was a time

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:20.333
when I liked Joo Ho-jin.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:29.258
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.431
Why won't they let us in?

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.934
I thought you said you understood English.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.060
You're useless!

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:42.188
I'm telling you,
they have weird accents I can't make out.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.148
Even Ji-sun didn't understand.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.943
Ho-jin's on the phone now,
so we'll find out soon.

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.530
They say we told the Ministry of Tourism
we're shooting tomorrow.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.822
Tomorrow?

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.159
Producer Kim's trouble until the very end!

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.369
That pain in the ass.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:00.206
They said the park office is inside
and suggested we talk to them directly.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:03.626
We need to shoot before the park opens
and gets too crowded.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.421
- Should we go plead with them?
- Yes. Mr. Joo, please come with us.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.590
Go let the cast know.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.847
Can you let Mu-hee know that the shoot
will be delayed by at least 30 minutes?

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.099
Sure, will do.

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.016
Thanks.

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:29.527
There was a time when I liked Joo Ho-jin.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.738
Things sure are complicated.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:16.198
What are you doing there?

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:21.203
She was a dying zombie yesterday,
but I guess she's been revived.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.126
Taking pictures again?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.258
You shouldn't wander the forest alone.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.344
They say Canadian forests have bears.

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.012
Bear…

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.513
How do you say "bear" again?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.974
Fu…

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:45.311
Fu Bao!

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:46.687
Bear!

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:49.899
What's that?

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.109
You know, bears!

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.194
You'll be eaten!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.656
Oh, bear?

00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.450
Yes, bear. That's it.

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.662
That was nothing like a bear.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.998
Plus, you're more dangerous than a bear.
You're a zombie.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:12.004
Your hands are really red.
You definitely have poor circulation.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:13.923
Freezing, right?

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.133
What are you doing?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.386
You should really carry around
some heat packs.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.680
Want some of mine?

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:32.608
Here. They're warm.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.530
I stuck a bunch of them on me,
so I'll be fine.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:41.742
And eat this.

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.119
It's

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:44.954
sugar-free.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.331
No sugar. No fat.

00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:49.375
Candy?

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.043
- This is ame?
- Yes, ame.

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:54.547
So candy is "ame" in Japanese?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.925
We may not speak the same language,

00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:02.304
but things that feel warm or taste sweet
are surely universal.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:11.355
Nanami said that you glowed
when you were with me.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.192
Since we're alone, I can check for sure.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.195
One can sense these things
despite not speaking the same language.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.039
Now, if you have something to say,

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:31.667
please say it into this.

00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:45.556
Glowing.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.229
Glowing.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.608
"Glowing"?

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:57.610
What is?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.040
So this is what was glowing.

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:16.670
My earrings? What about them?

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.308
Man, that was close.

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:31.977
Imagine if I'd asked her if she likes me.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.395
What would've happened?

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.485
I don't like you!

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.339
So there really are bears around here.

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.218
Bear! You'll be eaten!

00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.531
Don't things look good?

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.047
- What a relief!
- Man, that was stressful.

00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:46.677
Mu-hee, thank you so much.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.304
Do Ra-mi is the best!

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.513
Thank you.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.056
Mu-hee, you should stay here.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.601
Once the gates open,
we'll all drive up here anyway.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.436
- Let's go, Ho-jin.
- Sure.

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.027
Stay here.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.284
You promised to teach me basic Japanese.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.578
Ho-jin, don't go back down.

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:13.996
Just stay here with me.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.960
Hey, I'll wait here too.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.129
All right, then.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:31.805
So…

00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.851
you wanted me to teach you Japanese?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.105
No, that was just…

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.653
You said you were afraid of her.
I was protecting you.

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.572
Thanks for looking out for me,

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.617
but I'm not so tuned in to her
that this feels awkward.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.577
Do you see me

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.664
as some lovesick teen
pining over unrequited love?

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:57.915
So it's not that bad?

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:02.878
I was worried you had been restless,
tossing and turning every night.

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:10.427
Wait up.

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:16.600
- Isn't the Sun in your eyes?
- It is.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:17.643
How about now?

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.605
Careful.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.273
Walk this way.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.986
Canadians seem

00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.197
so warm and friendly.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.576
Maybe it's because they live
somewhere quiet and with fresh air?

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:37.246
The park isn't open yet.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.959
Once it opens, it'll be crowded and loud.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.130
You've been here before too?

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:50.175
Yes, as a kid with my family,
when we lived in the US.

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.178
Further that way,
there's a small waterfall.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:54.555
A waterfall?

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.516
It's not far. About a 20-minute walk.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.936
- Do you want to see it? Want to go?
- I do.

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.027
Careful.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:18.954
What is it?

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.291
Sorry. I can't find it.
It must not be this way.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:26.336
With your sense of direction,
of course you wouldn't find the way.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.339
If we keep wandering, we'll be late.
Let's turn back.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.925
No way you're taking the lead. Follow me.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.553
But… it's this way.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.516
Or maybe it is this way.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.606
What a view.

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:53.363
There must be a waterfall
somewhere on that mountain, right?

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:55.783
There definitely

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:57.993
was one.

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:00.829
Is that it?

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:03.332
Where?

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.334
Right there. Can't you see the waterfall?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.712
There. It's just over there.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.671
I don't see it--

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.006
Just say that you see it.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.674
Sure, let's say I do.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.470
Then this isn't a lake. It's a waterfall.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.101
Wow, a waterfall.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.145
If you insist
that any falling water is a waterfall,

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.356
tap water would also be a waterfall.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.734
Okay, sure. This is a waterfall. Yep.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.905
No one in the world
would call this a waterfall.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:36.782
Then this is a waterfall

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.993
that only you and I know about.

00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.330
Fine. Let's say it's a waterfall.

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.167
Wow.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.586
The waterfall's nice and cool.

00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:28.834
Do Ra-mi made me do it.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.128
She made me threaten you.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.464
I told you to watch out.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.561
Cha Mu…

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:53.567
Thanks for an amazing shoot in Canada!

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:02.910
- Nice.
- You're good.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.287
But now we have to aim here.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.623
Bam! Yeah, hit it head-on.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.916
Wow, you did so well!

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.168
She sure looks fine after threatening me.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.590
That's it! Do you get it now?

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:20.552
They can't communicate,
but they're strategizing?

00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:22.095
- "Nigiru"?
- Yeah.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:23.222
What does that mean?

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:25.349
Attention, everyone!

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.560
In a desperate moment of crisis,

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:31.939
I bring to you the elite warrior duo,
here to avenge the crew.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.357
Please come in!

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:48.497
All right, then. Let's resume the match!

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.998
Let's crush them!

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:13.689
Great job!

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:15.983
How did he even manage that?

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.609
We have one player left!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:24.449
Joo Ho-jin!

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.326
- Go on.
- Joo Ho-jin!

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.871
- You can do it!
- Just push that one out of the way.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.499
If it stops in the middle, we win.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.626
You've got this.

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.921
- Let's go!
- Let's win this thing!

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.339
It's okay. We did good.

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.923
It's okay.

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.176
You did great.

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.179
It's okay.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:29.765
Joo Ho-jin!

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.475
Joo Ho-jin!

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.863
Joo Ho-jin!

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:48.700
- Joo Ho-jin! Joo…
- Joo Ho-jin!

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:49.951
Joo Ho-jin!

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:51.453
Sorry?

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:52.996
Everyone.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:56.708
Hiro says that,
to celebrate the crew's curling victory,

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.210
drinks are on him tonight!

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:05.550
Hiro!

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:09.471
Hiro!

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.890
Thank you!

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.726
Thank you, everyone!

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:28.824
He said he hated losing,
but he doesn't seem too mad about it.

00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:32.202
You said you hate losing,

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:34.704
but you don't seem too mad about losing.

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:37.416
It was so much fun
that I didn't mind losing.

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.753
He said that he had a lot of fun.

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:10.240
Thank you for your hard work.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.082
You didn't like Ms. Cha Mu-hee at first,

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.626
but while filming,
you seem to have changed your mind.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:22.961
No.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.590
I hate that zombie even more now.

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:30.469
Thanks to her, I've become a joke.

00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:37.350
- Joo Ho-jin!
- Knock it off.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.901
Could I ask you for one more favor?

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:50.947
Mr. Joo, are you looking
to get married at all?

00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:52.532
I'm sorry?

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:56.161
We're working on a dating show,

00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:58.163
and, Mr. Joo, I really,

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:02.375
really… really want you
as one of our noncelebrity contestants.

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.630
I don't think I can help you there.

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:09.174
So it's a no after all.

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:13.929
I asked Producer Shin about it recently,
and she said you'd say no.

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.723
I hear you've liked someone
for a very long time.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.435
That's what Ji-sun told me.
Is that not true?

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:27.275
Is… it not?

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.612
Goodness me.

00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:32.656
I should call home.

00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:34.574
Excuse me a moment.

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.118
Why did I bring up his private life…

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.796
Mic test.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.965
Can I have your attention, please?

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:55.720
Thank you all for your work on this shoot,
despite the cold weather.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.103
I have another gig in Korea,

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:06.690
so I'll be leaving before the rest of you.

00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:10.569
I'll see you all soon in Italy.
Thank you again.

00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:31.381
You're heading back already?

00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:34.676
You can stay longer.
We just need to leave by 8:00 tomorrow.

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.470
No, let's call it a night.

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.932
Okay. Wait here. I'll get the car.

00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:59.135
Why is my movie suddenly playing?

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:17.070
Hey!

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.613
Did I surprise you?

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:19.948
It's me.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:23.993
Why are you so shocked?

00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:28.248
You've been talking to him
about me a lot lately.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.835
Whatever. Get lost.

00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:34.713
You kissed him thanks to me.
Now you're acting coy?

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:42.929
Follow me.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.098
I'll show you something fun.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.089
Mr. Joo Ho-jin!

00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:19.174
Now,

00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:23.011
I'm going to ask you some questions
Cha Mu-hee wants answers to.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.141
You know she's leaving first tomorrow.
Why didn't you reach out?

00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:29.893
Don't you care if she leaves?

00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:42.238
She kissed you,

00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:45.074
and you're not reacting at all?

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.745
So it really meant nothing to you?

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:59.088
You said you'd never ask her out,
even if someone threatened you into it.

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.178
Is this you keeping that promise?

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.396
Love Shin Ji-sun that much?

00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:24.489
Please stop.
Don't ask him those questions.

00:30:27.867 --> 00:30:30.620
Do you really…

00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:35.333
not have

00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:37.877
any feelings

00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:39.921
for Cha Mu-hee

00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:41.339
whatsoever?

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:05.363
You answer that question.

00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:07.824
You already know your answer.

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:34.225
You know the answer
has already been decided,

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.686
so why are you acting like this?

00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:44.402
Cha Mu-hee is a girl
who can never be loved.

00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.322
That was decided long ago.

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.097
Didn't you go to bed early?

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.016
I couldn't sleep.

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:16.559
I'll just sleep on the plane.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:19.771
Yong-u.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.148
There are no auroras in Korea, right?

00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:24.400
Of course not.
It would be crazy to see one.

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:30.615
Right. That would be crazy.

00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:57.517
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:32:58.017 --> 00:33:00.228
I'll drive you to the airport.
Wanna get in?

00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:22.875
Mu-hee!

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:24.752
Mr. Joo!

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.008
Where are they even going?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.415
It's Cory Lane.

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:06.335
He's a Canadian singer.

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.838
A very famous singer-songwriter.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.924
I see.

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.343
So he's super famous.

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.972
It does feel like
I've heard this song before.

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:25.396
Aren't you tired?

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.732
You must've been up late drinking.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.358
I didn't drink.

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:33.571
I got back early too. I didn't reach out
in case you had an early night.

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:36.824
Oh.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.452
I see.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:43.790
I

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.459
didn't sleep too well.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.880
I couldn't sleep
because it felt so unfair.

00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:52.715
How could you threaten me like that,

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:56.052
act as though it never happened,
and then leave just like that?

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:57.762
Is this about the gunshot?

00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:02.809
I mean, that was…

00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:05.436
Well, yes.

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:09.565
I guess it was about as shocking
as getting shot.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:13.402
How can you shoot someone and walk off?

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:17.323
You know I'm bad with directions,
yet you left me helplessly alone.

00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.408
That day,

00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:22.203
I told you that Do Ra-mi made me do it,

00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:25.706
but I couldn't smooth things over,
so I avoided you.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.834
I wasn't sure how to deal with it.

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:30.628
You are the type to act on a whim,

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:32.964
then deal with the fallout afterward.

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:37.009
By pretending you never said anything
or by deflecting and running away.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:42.181
I came here to grab hold of you,
in case you might do that again.

00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:45.810
That's because you didn't seem
the least bit curious.

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:48.938
I didn't sleep a wink either.

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:54.402
Don't run this time.

00:35:58.197 --> 00:36:01.159
Because I'm giving it serious thought.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.833
I'm… the type
who needs to gather their thoughts

00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:11.752
before saying something,
especially if it's important.

00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:20.428
Which is why I'm going to do something
I vowed I never would.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.681
I'm gonna talk to Ji-sun.

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:31.731
I don't want you to think I am pathetic.

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.747
I agonized over it too…

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.251
because this time…

00:36:58.257 --> 00:37:00.676
I didn't want to pretend
I never said what I said…

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.223
or just run away.

00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:28.204
Take a nap on the way to the airport.

00:37:28.287 --> 00:37:29.789
You said you didn't get any sleep.

00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:33.125
I don't want to.

00:37:38.214 --> 00:37:40.883
This Mr. Cory Lane is a great singer.

00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:47.556
Mr. Joo Ho-jin,
you're catching the red-eye, right?

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:50.268
What will you do until then? Sightsee?

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:53.437
Ms. Cho is treating
the curling team to lunch.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.692
Right, the prince of the curling rink.

00:38:00.403 --> 00:38:01.988
Then what will you do after lunch?

00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:03.698
I haven't decided yet.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.574
But

00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:10.329
I'll call you once I decide.

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:13.958
Though you'll be on the plane by then.

00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:18.629
Then I'll call you when you land
and let you know.

00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:23.426
Okay.

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.222
You'd better call me.

00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.278
The weather is lovely.

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:47.325
Isn't the song lovely too?

00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:09.281
There you are.

00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:11.575
Mu-hee, what are you doing?

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:13.327
I'm listening to music.

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:16.372
The song Mr. Joo and I listened to
on the drive over.

00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:20.418
It's by a singer he likes,
and he said the lyrics are great.

00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:21.961
Mu-hee.

00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:24.380
I'm not asking about the singer.

00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:26.048
Yong-u.

00:40:26.882 --> 00:40:29.093
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:37.893
The wedding is off.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.441
Producer Shin broke up with her fiancé.

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:46.026
I was there
when she told him on the phone.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.410
Is that right?

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:58.914
Mr. Joo Ho-jin didn't seem to know.

00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:01.041
He will soon.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.712
I'm gonna talk to Ji-sun.

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:09.508
It's harder to move on
when the person you like becomes single.

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:13.304
Does Ho-jin like you enough
for it not to matter?

00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:17.516
Does he?

00:41:21.061 --> 00:41:23.230
If that's the case,
I was worried about nothing.

00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:26.942
He's not the type to be swayed
after telling you he wouldn't,

00:41:27.443 --> 00:41:28.944
so there's no need to worry.

00:41:35.034 --> 00:41:36.368
I'd better go.

00:41:39.538 --> 00:41:41.540
To be honest, I was too scared to ask.

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:44.877
I'd better see him before they talk.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:48.464
Wait, Mu-hee!

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:21.580
Even as I'm listening,
I have no idea what this song is about,

00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:23.666
so translate the lyrics for me next time.

00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.876
As we listen to it together.

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:37.137
Here you are.

00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:39.265
Are you here to buy records?

00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:41.475
Yeah.

00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:43.769
I was thinking of buying some books.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.815
Can you recommend a few books
for me to read on the plane?

00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:49.858
Ji-sun.

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:53.821
I was actually hoping
to talk to you after lunch.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.116
I'm glad I ran into you. We need to talk.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.244
Yeah.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.705
We should talk.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.165
Let's.

00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:06.500
This looks good.

00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:08.669
It's my treat,

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.504
so anything expensive

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.506
is off the table.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.466
Come on, Ms. Cho.

00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:18.012
- Can we have this steak?
- Just order noodles.

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:25.311
Mu-hee? What are you doing here?
Did you miss your flight?

00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:27.313
You came here with Mr. Joo, right?

00:43:28.063 --> 00:43:28.897
Where is he?

00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:33.527
He's not here. He said
he was stopping by a bookstore.

00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:42.328
So you didn't know the wedding was off?

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:45.414
Didn't Jin-suk call you?

00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:50.419
I thought you were
just pretending not to know.

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:54.089
I did think the silence was strange.

00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:56.550
He always calls me when you two argue.

00:43:57.384 --> 00:44:00.763
I figured your argument was serious enough
to keep him from calling.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:07.645
I know Jin-suk must have bugged you a lot
whenever we had problems.

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:11.315
I think I relied on you a lot too.

00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:15.778
Don't worry about smoothing things over
between us this time.

00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:19.156
Even better if you just pretend
not to know what's going on.

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:23.452
You wanted to discuss this, right?

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:26.288
- Let's join the others for lunch.
- Ji-sun.

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.256
What a wonderful romance movie.
A perfect happy ending.

00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:01.759
What about me?

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:05.929
You're, well… just a supporting character
who got in their way for a while?

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:08.098
Or maybe the villain,
since you threatened him.

00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:11.143
What about the aurora? And the waterfall?

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.270
The song we listened to together?

00:46:15.981 --> 00:46:19.985
Sure, there were scenes like that, too,
but that's how the story came to an end,

00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:23.822
so just erase them and move on.
Otherwise, it's just sad and pathetic.

00:46:24.573 --> 00:46:26.700
If you stay between those two,

00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.829
the ending you already know
will replay over and over in your mind.

00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:34.708
Isn't it sad to see them?
Isn't it painful? Agonizing?

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:39.338
So just pretend you saw nothing,
know nothing, and it meant nothing.

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:43.717
You're good at that.

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:45.886
Just like back then.

00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:56.355
That's it. Just do what you did back then.

00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:59.775
Act like you saw nothing,
know nothing, and it meant nothing.

00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.360
Run away!

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:17.543
I said I'm okay.

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:21.421
What's the matter?

00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:27.302
You go ahead.

00:47:29.555 --> 00:47:30.597
Joo Ho-jin!

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.449
I must have been mad.

00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:52.160
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:47:57.165 --> 00:47:59.793
What are you doing here?
You should be on a plane by now.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.256
I'll catch a later flight.

00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:06.842
- Don't worry about me and go.
- Where's Yong-u?

00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:10.554
At the airport.
I should hurry over there now.

00:48:10.637 --> 00:48:11.763
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, wait.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:17.311
Let's go wash this off, then talk.

00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:27.279
I heard Producer Shin
isn't getting married.

00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:32.826
You heard, didn't you?
You were with her earlier.

00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:36.288
Yes, I heard.

00:48:42.127 --> 00:48:43.128
That's great.

00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.131
Sorry?

00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:50.385
Now you don't need to run away
or grab onto someone else to avoid her.

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:53.764
I hope things work out this time.

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:02.397
You missed your flight
and came here to tell me that?

00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:07.736
I need to get back to the airport.
You should go to her. She'll be waiting.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.993
I know you blurt things out
when you're flustered.

00:49:15.535 --> 00:49:19.289
Just stop… and say what you want to say,
instead of running away.

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.543
That's it. Just do what you did back then.

00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:26.922
Act like you saw nothing,
know nothing, and it meant nothing.

00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:27.839
Run away!

00:49:29.758 --> 00:49:30.926
You…

00:49:33.887 --> 00:49:36.056
don't like me very much.

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.940
That's why I came all this way.

00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:48.276
It hurt my pride. Got me fired up, even.

00:49:50.445 --> 00:49:52.948
Whatever it took,
I wanted to make you fall for me,

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:58.120
but I didn't think it'd be possible
once you learned her wedding was off.

00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:05.669
So I missed my flight and rushed over here
to see you before you found out.

00:50:06.712 --> 00:50:07.754
You were…

00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:13.010
at least a little shaken by my threat,
weren't you?

00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:19.182
But…

00:50:23.478 --> 00:50:24.479
I was too late.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:30.235
I told you Do Ra-mi was like a hater
and that she talked about you.

00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:36.867
She kept taunting me.

00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:41.371
That it'd never work.
You'd never fall for me.

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.292
And so…

00:50:48.086 --> 00:50:51.548
I'm going to just accept the fact
that you don't like me and give up.

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:54.968
If I keep going…

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.638
I'll look like such a fool.

00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:08.648
If I keep going, even now…

00:51:12.277 --> 00:51:14.321
I would feel so guilty.

00:51:21.703 --> 00:51:22.579
I understand.

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:28.168
I'm sorry if I made you feel like a fool.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.837
Let's stop here.

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:39.638
I sorted my thoughts
and made them clear to Ji-sun,

00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:41.515
so no need to feel guilty.

00:51:44.726 --> 00:51:46.353
Did your talk go well?

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.480
Why should I tell you,

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.525
given where we're at now?

00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:59.074
Seeing you wear your heart on your sleeve,
crying, laughing, changing,

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.577
I was baffled but also fascinated.

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:07.666
I came to worry about you,
to want to go along with what you wanted…

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.088
and I wanted to take care of you.

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.966
But now that I think about it,

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:19.052
I was just being swayed by your emotions.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.723
It's best to end things here.

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:30.063
This is

00:52:31.231 --> 00:52:34.151
the exact same situation
as the day we parted at the crosswalk.

00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:39.656
You were standing
on the other side of the train tracks…

00:52:42.367 --> 00:52:44.035
and I told you to go and get her.

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.332
Just like that day…

00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:55.881
goodbye, Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.219
Don't try to brush this off
like it was nothing.

00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:04.931
I feel very wronged.

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.812
I was getting ready to cross the street

00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:13.440
to the person I like.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.370
Are you sure Do Ra-mi was wrong
and that you won?

00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:30.582
I hope that's the case.

00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:32.709
I did say I'd root for you.

00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:47.993
I thought I was gonna lose my mind.

00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:50.996
I was able to book a flight
with a stop in Japan, so we need to…

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:53.498
Mu-hee.

00:54:57.502 --> 00:54:58.503
I…

00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:02.716
ruined everything.

00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:24.404
Did Ho-jin reject you again?

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:26.948
Come here.

00:55:29.367 --> 00:55:30.577
Who does he think he is?

00:55:31.536 --> 00:55:32.787
He's not all that.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.911
The reason I mediated between you two

00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:14.913
wasn't because Jin-suk bugged me

00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:16.956
or because you relied on me.

00:56:17.832 --> 00:56:19.876
As long as your relationship was intact,

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:24.047
I could ensure
that my world was safe and peaceful.

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:31.596
But a certain someone
started shaking up my world.

00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:38.186
I tried pushing her away, afraid the world
I'd protected would break and shatter,

00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:42.357
but light shone in
through the cracks she made.

00:57:30.488 --> 00:57:31.573
Are you okay?

00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:42.000
Are you okay?

00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:45.211
You haven't budged since earlier.

00:57:47.714 --> 00:57:48.923
Are you unwell?

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:21.748
TWO WEEKS LATER, KOREA

00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:26.753
As you asked, I didn't tell
the production crew you're in Korea.

00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:30.507
As for Ms. Cha Mu-hee,

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:34.636
she'll be attending a concert
sponsored by an advertiser.

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:39.015
I know you didn't ask me to,

00:58:39.098 --> 00:58:41.684
but I thought
I'd check her schedule just in case.

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.645
A concert?

00:58:45.313 --> 00:58:47.649
She went to a concert
without a care in the world?

00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.069
After what she did to me?

00:59:09.587 --> 00:59:11.339
Is the woman next to me an actress?

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:13.424
Pardon?

00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:16.261
Yes, she's an actress.

00:59:16.844 --> 00:59:19.722
Mr. Kim, I wonder if you've heard of her.

00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:22.100
She's Do Ra-mi, the--

00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:23.059
Cha Mu-hee?

00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:24.852
Yes, that was her name.

00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:27.272
Wait, you know her name?

00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:29.691
- Of course I know Cha Mu-hee.
- Oh, really?

00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:36.322
I think today's concert

00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:38.283
will be very interesting.

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.457
Hello.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.023
"Hello."

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:14.402
"I am Roberto Vancini,
the Ambassador of Italy to Korea."

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:18.865
"Thank you for attending this concert
hosted by the Italian Embassy,

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:23.828
commemorating the 140th anniversary
of Korea-Italy diplomatic relations."

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:39.135
"I hope tonight's musical journey to Italy

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:43.431
becomes a beautiful
and delightful memory for you."

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:44.515
"Thank you."

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:35.733
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:03:55.998 --> 01:04:01.003
