00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:12.739
Shujing.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.000
It's four in the morning,
nonstop calls like this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.699
Do you think
I'm some kind of AI hotline?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.339
Tan Zheng'en got away last night.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.780
But don't worry about him yet.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.139
Why not?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.059
Go find someone named Zhao Youcai first.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.459
And do it fast.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.059
Zhao Youcai?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.980
Something feels

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.619
off.

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:45.899
=Secret By My Name=

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.599

Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

(Termination Letter)

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.939
Back then, my father opened this bottle

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.060
to celebrate my seat on the board.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.899
Now it seems fitting to use it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.019
(Termination Letter)

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.459
to mourn my loyalty.

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:15.459
Leave with some dignity.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.819
Don't force me
to expose your dirty secrets.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.459
Dignity?

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.099
You mean like you,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.099
kept on a leash by Li Shujing,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.459
treated like a dog at her bedside,
yet calling it devotion?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.340
And still bragging about love?

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:34.500
I'm warning you.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.860
Don't say her name
with that filthy mouth again.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:38.900
Stay away from her.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.379
Sorry.

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.019
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:46.539
What a touching show

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.459
of loyalty and love.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.258
Tell me, if she ever finds out
about what happened back then,

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.218
that you knew everything in advance,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.498
and even took part in it,

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:57.618
once she learns the truth,

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.459
do you think she would...

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.579
Do you think she would

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.659
stab you herself?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980
I wasn't involved.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.099
That's something

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.300
only you believe.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.099
Pass this message to her for me.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.379
That secret

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.939
hidden inside those bite marks

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.419
is enough for you two

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.379
to keep turning on
each other for a lifetime.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.620
Dad. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.379
You always said datura is poisonous.

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.659
But without a bit of aggression,
how do you strike a snake at its weak spot?

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.419
Just wait.

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.659
Someone will come very soon

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.580
to pay for their sins.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.979
(Tan Zuoyan.)

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.340
(Li Shujing.)

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.819
(What are you planning to do next?)

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.379
(Dad.)

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.179
(That factory of yours back then)

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060
(has now been rated as one of the city's
outstanding old industrial sites.)

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.539
(Even though it's still
in the Tan family's hands,)

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.500
(I'll find a way)

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.460
(to take it back.)

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.739
Zhao Youcai.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.699
We should start
with the list of old factory sites.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.579
Dragged out by Li Shujing
at four in the morning,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.340
summoned and dismissed at will,

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.739
and left me there alone.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.538
Mr. Liang,

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.099
do you think that's appropriate?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.259
(Nurses' Station)

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.938
Why are you waiting here for me?

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.579
If someone hears this,
they'll think I did something to you.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.020
I don't care what people think.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.859
You've always had one foot in each camp,

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.460
physically here, but loyal elsewhere.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:05.579
So tell me.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.979
Why did Li Shujing look for you?

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.979
Nothing.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.938
She just asked
about her mother's recovery.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.580
Her mom felt unwell early this morning.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.139
Right.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.139
You climb out of bed
at four and leaves me,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.979
then feeds me

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.419
such a lousy excuse.

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:21.579
Mr. Liang,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.979
what exactly are we to each other?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.979
Can't you
at least sweet-talk me a little?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:33.858
(Did Li Shujing)

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:35.700
(stumble onto something crucial?)

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.820
(Is that why she rushed to verify it?)

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.380
(Should I tell the old man about this?)

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.179
Let me treat you to breakfast.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.099
At the hospital cafeteria?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.819
If you don't feel like it...

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.340
I never said I wouldn't eat.

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.260
Let's go.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.140
Surprised to see me?

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.538
We only just

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.580
ended our partnership not long ago.

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:23.619
You've already lost across the board.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.480
What leverage do you have
to negotiate with me?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.380
You don't seriously think

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.700
Tan Jianfei
is some kind of saint, do you?

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.538
You think he's told you

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.780
everything?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.939
You should clean up

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.859
your own mess first.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.419
But next time,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.658
if you dare touch my mother again...

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:47.979
Even once,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.099
Ms. Li,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.619
will you kneel and beg me again?

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:56.619
You're insane.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.940
Li Shujing.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.140
Li Shujing.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.459
Consider this

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.820
my farewell gift to you.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.920
Gossip and scandal
are everyone's favorite pastime.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.619
Who doesn't love talking

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.340
about a woman accused of loose morals?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.579
(Tan Group executives entangled in chaos)
Tan Group executives entangled in chaos,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.979
truly disgraceful.

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:32.019
The Tan Group

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.539
has no need for a director
with moral stains.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.619
Li Shujing, get out of the Tan Group.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.140
Moral stains?

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.859
Everyone here,

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.580
keeping mistresses,

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.299
hiding lovers away,
there are plenty of you, aren't there?

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.700
So what,

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.059
it's double standards
when it comes to me?

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.819
Ever since you joined the Tan Group,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.658
trouble has followed one after another.

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:56.778
You're nothing but bad luck.

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:57.940
Get out now.

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.418
Yeah, get out.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.178
That's right.

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:01.320
This is beyond disappointing.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.580
I want to see who dares.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.680
Track down the person who posted this.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.179
I want results within thirty minutes.

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.059
Yes.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.778
Li Shujing runs
the company's most critical brand.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.619
If she's gone, do you really think a bunch
of well-fed deadweight

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.900
like you can keep the Tan Group afloat?

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.940
I don't want to hear this again.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.020
Otherwise,

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:34.619
all of you can get out.

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:35.820
Meeting adjourned.

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:38.220
Let's go.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:52.099
Don't take those comments to heart.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.780
It's fine.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.619
I'm not that fragile.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.780
You've been going through those files
for nearly three hours.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.140
You should take a break.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.979
Thanks.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:21.939
There's no way

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.979
Zhao Youcai just disappeared.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.282
(Tan Jianfei)

00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:32.520
(Tan Jianfei)

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.260
Come swimming with me.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:44.619
Alright.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.019
I didn't realize

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.418
Young Chairman Tan
was such a strong swimmer.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:57.540
You wouldn't know.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.899
This is a Tan Group original,

00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:02.019
a crisis-response drill.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.019
Watch.

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:05.259
Buoyancy check passed.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.060
Impressive, Young Chairman Tan.

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.859
The whole company
should learn from this.

00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:14.732
Li Shujing, don't.

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.345
- Three, two, one. Smile.
- Don't.

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:18.499
Delete it.

00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:23.557
Stop filming.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.979
Delete it right now.
Delete it. Give it to me.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.019
- Keep one. Just one.
- Delete it. You can't post it.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:32.938
Fine, I'll delete it.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.859
Then trade it
for Wang Jinkai's old files.

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.019
So you didn't come just to swim.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:46.578
After all,

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:48.578
the Autumn Winter
Alpine Collection launch

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.139
is coming up fast.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.700
If you wanted it,

00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:56.259
you could have told me directly.

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.099
Anything I can give, I will.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.019
Feeling moved?

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.680
How are you going to thank me?

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.259
Now I owe you a reward too?

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:10.060
That's pretty stingy for a grown man.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.019
Aren't you good at swimming?

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:15.899
Teach me.

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:17.060
Sure.
