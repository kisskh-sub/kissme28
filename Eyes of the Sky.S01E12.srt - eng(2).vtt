00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.840
Lin Yun

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.480
Master, you're finally awake.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560
I found it. It's the third doll on the left.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.640
No.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.120
Chu Chen gave me those.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.200
Lin Yun.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.200
Still angry?

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:28.640
Lin Yun.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.959
Listen to my explanation.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.040
This is what Chu Chen gave to Bai Xinhui.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.680
It uses Du Sze's technology.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.120
It can control people's minds.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.599
That's how I was harmed by him.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.480
Believe me. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.680
You don't need to explain to me.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.040
You're free to do whatever you want.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.560
I...

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.079
I'm not making excuses.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.159
I'm trying to say there's something wrong with Chu Chen.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.239
There is nothing wrong with Chu Chen.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.959
He just wants to acquire Du Sze's company.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.480
Don't you know there's a problem with Du Sze?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.680
Chu Chen will keep him in check.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.280
Their goal is Cang Qiong.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
Are you done?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.439
You trust them that much?

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.520
Before the final cut in a pig-butchering scam,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.080
people trust them just like you do.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.639
Is it because of Bai Xinhui?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.520
There is really nothing between Bai Xinhui and me.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.840
You have to believe me.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.639
Except for charging,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.120
you never actively look for me.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.639
What am I in your eyes?

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.560
A power bank? A portable charger?

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.840
As for Chu Chen, he's different.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.840
He was abroad for so many years,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.800
yet he remembers that whenever I accelerate while driving,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.879
it means I'm sleepy.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.680
That I love cilantro.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.120
That I'm allergic to eggs.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.560
Do you know that?

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.759
Do you understand that?

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.719
Do you get me?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.599
Move out. Leave this place.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.639
So your AI Eye

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.560
relies on Lin Yun to recharge.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.039
Without power, it's useless trash.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.319
Huo Ming.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.840
I never expected your biggest weakness to be Lin Yun.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.759
Boss, that's impressive.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.639
You found his weakness so quickly.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680
Boss.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.560
You transitioned into the role quite naturally.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.680
Thank you for the compliment, Boss.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.319
It is my honor to follow you, Boss.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.360
Huo Ming's AI Eye

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.280
fuses so perfectly with his cerebral nerves.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.080
What a magnificent test subject.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.879
Boss.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840
Why don't we just take some men and grab Huo Ming,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.719
to do research on him?

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.520
Do you know why you can't beat Huo Ming?

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.360
Why?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.080
You look like you have a high IQ,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.479
but you do nothing but stupid things.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.599
Yes.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.240
Then what should we...

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.439
Stop always thinking about fighting and killing.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.960
Use your brain.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.759
Since he needs Lin Yun to recharge,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.879
we make sure he can't recharge.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.639
A phone without a battery,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.519
is useless no matter how smart it is.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.279
Boss, brilliant.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.639
Get lost.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:27.680
You got it.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.439
Huo Ming, just go.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.160
I've packed your things for you.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.360
How can I make Lin Yun believe

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.319
that there's something wrong with that kid Chu Chen?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.079
Finally found you.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.839
Let's go. There's a jade auction needing an expert eye.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.959
Come do a guest appearance.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.759
Not in the mood.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.160
What's wrong?

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.519
Had a fight with Lin Yun?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.120
How did you know?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.040
That's a good thing. Why the long face?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.639
Come on, give me a smile. Smile.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.720
Xiao Hui, do me a favor.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.480
Keep an eye on Chu Chen for me.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920
I think there's something wrong with him.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.959
Chu Chen played me, too.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.079
I've got people watching him closely, too.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.839
Just now they reported that...

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.360
he went to a gym.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.839
Found a beautiful female coach.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.279
The two of them were flirting and getting cozy...

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.560
He went to a gym?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.040
Who did he go to see?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.800
I don't know.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.879
Anyway, it's called Xiaoxue Gym or something.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.480
Lend me your car.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.040
Xiao Cang.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.639
Activate AI Eye intelligent analysis.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.480
Yes, Master.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.160
Analyzing lip movements.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.279
They are discussing the research institute from back then.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.720
So they knew each other all along.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:20.879
Hello.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.040
Your delivery is here.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.439
I didn't order delivery.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:25.639
Must be a mistake.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.439
No mistake.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.639
Fried chicken and fries.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:32.480
Ordered for you.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.000
Huo Ming.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.000
Don't you know fried chicken is the gym's

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.759
number one enemy?

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.439
People come here to work out.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.680
They all care about body management.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.720
I know.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.519
So I brought you a fruit and vegetable smoothie.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.399
Guilt-free, tasty, and non-fattening.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.639
Business is pretty good at the gym today.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.120
Even Chu Chen came to get a membership.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.839
What are you talking about?

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.240
Why would Chu Chen come here?

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.319
I must have seen it wrong.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.959
I'm going to class.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.160
She's lying to cover something up.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.199
Analyze all the research institute data for me.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.240
See if you can find any clues about Chu Chen.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.639
Integrating analysis, searching for key information.

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.879
Master, I found it.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.680
Chu Chen is definitely suspicious.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.680
Lin Yun, look at this photo.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.240
He knew my father a long time ago.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.360
Yet he pretended not to know him.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
He's quite the actor.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.079
Chu Chen worked at the research institute back then.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.240
Many people know that.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.839
You weren't there at the time, so you didn't know him.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.879
I was the one who introduced him to the institute.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:00.160
Three years ago, when the accident happened at the institute,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.639
he went abroad just a couple of days later.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.879
Is there really such a coincidence?

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.160
Even if he isn't the mastermind,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.199
he's still highly suspicious, right?

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.240
Chu Chen's plan to go abroad

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.000
was decided long before that.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.319
Even if nothing happened at the institute,

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.560
he would have left on schedule.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.199
That could have been planned too.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.360
He destroys the institute first,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.959
then goes abroad to clear himself of suspicion.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.040
Huo Ming.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.720
I know you hate Chu Chen,

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.319
but without evidence, you can't just

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.600
make wild speculations about others.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.120
I...

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.720
You're like a completely different person now.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.040
You are controlled by jealousy.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.839
I'm controlled by jealousy?

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.480
You're the one being controlled, Lin Yun.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.959
You should go.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.480
You've been practically brainwashed by him.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.039
Boss, that was brilliant.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.759
They were inseparable before,

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.080
but now they're about to break up.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.200
My relationship with Lin Yun...

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.480
how can a delivery guy like him compare?

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.240
Then he can't go to Lin Yun to recharge now.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.360
Our chance has come.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.440
I'll arrange for someone to deal with him right now.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.519
I told you, stop always thinking about fighting and killing.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.639
Use your brain.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120
Yes, Boss.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.799
Then... then what do we do now?

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.840
I'll send you Dr. Shen's number in a moment.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:08.879
Just tell her the last researcher has been found.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.600
And then?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.639
I have my own plans.

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:18.840
The number.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.759
You go first, I'll send it to you in a bit.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.759
Got it.

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:32.399
Huo Ming.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.080
Dr. Shen.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.399
I received a call today.

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.000
It said the last researcher has been found.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.440
Who called?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.120
I don't know, it was a strange number.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.200
They hung up right after speaking.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:41.679
Could it be Mind-Bender?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.120
Mind-Bender is nothing more than

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.360
a puppet wearing a helmet.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.840
His true goal

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.960
is to find the seven researchers of Cang Qiong

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.559
and get the passwords they hold.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840
You're not safe either. Come with me.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.039
Wait a moment.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.759
This is the password.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.759
Huo Ming, it's safer with you.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.200
Thank you.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.320
I will definitely find out the truth.

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.960
I have some other clues.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.600
He was my doctoral supervisor.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.759
He participated in many major studies.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.200
I suspect

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.279
he is the last researcher we're looking for.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:26.559
Where is he?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.080
Professor Ning.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.600
Professor Ning.

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:44.799
What professor? Who are you looking for?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.240
Professor Ning.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.720
Mind-Bender has already found six researchers.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.000
The password you hold is also his target.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.320
If you don't want to end up in a vegetative state,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.399
you'd better choose to believe me.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.879
What is this nonsense?

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:56.399
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.279
Don't get in the way of my work, okay?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.159
Professor Ning, stop pretending.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.120
My father is Huo Haiyang.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.519
Come with me.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.799
I usually like to listen to some music.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.759
Here, have some water.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.039
Thank you.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.240
Professor Ning.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:42.440
Mind-Bender has now...

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:44.240
...already obtained four passwords.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.320
These are all researchers...

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.759
...whose memories were extracted by him.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.639
They have all been left in a vegetative state.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.559
They used to be your friends...

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.559
...students, and colleagues.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.799
I never expected...

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.360
...that their own scientific achievements...

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:00.879
...would harm them like this.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.000
Professor Ning.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.600
Cangqiong used part of the research...

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.960
...to create Mind-Bender.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.279
If they get their hands on all the research...

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:11.200
...the consequences will be unimaginable.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.159
Cangqiong isn't what you imagine.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.000
Once cracked, it will be even more dangerous.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.039
You're too impatient.

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:20.000
I...

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:22.440
I just want to keep the initiative...

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.759
...in my own hands.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.480
What are you laughing at?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.720
Master, system anomaly.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.200
System shutting down.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:45.799
There's something wrong with the water.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.200
There is nothing wrong with the water.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.799
I know you have the AI Eye.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.360
It can scan for and detect abnormal substances.

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:54.480
How do you know?

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:58.960
I led the development of the AI Eye.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.960
My research focus is intelligent assistive devices.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.759
I know it very well.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.960
But the AI Eye is just an eye, after all.

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.240
It can only see...

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.559
...it cannot hear.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.679
This playback device...

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.720
...emits sound waves at a special frequency.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.519
It creates vibrations that interfere with all electronics.

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:36.279
Even if Mind-Bender were here...

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.080
...he'd have to obediently shut down too.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.440
You know clearly that I am not Mind-Bender.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.440
Why are you doing this to me?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.120
I'm sorry, Huo Ming.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:57.399
You came too late.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.360
I have already reached a deal with him.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.559
I gave him the passwords too.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.879
Now, as long as I catch you...

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.240
...I will be safe.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.159
Professor Ning.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.399
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:17.279
Just leave me alone.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:21.559
Because I have so many unfinished projects.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.759
I don't want to become a vegetable yet.

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:31.159
Xiao Cang, boot up, quick!

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.919
After fighting you for so long...

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.960
...I'm actually a bit reluctant to end this.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.279
Xiao Cang, boot up, quick!

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.399
I really want to see...

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.559
...as Huo Haiyang's son...

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:44.240
...what else you actually know.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.399
I didn't expect it to go this smoothly.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.480
Extraction nearly complete.
