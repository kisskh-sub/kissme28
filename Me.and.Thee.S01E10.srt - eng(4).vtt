00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.620
Huh?

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.960
The family that adopted Marn hurt her.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.650
She’s in the hospital.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.500
Peach!

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.060
I feel so bad for her.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.050
It’s okay.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.200
She’s safe now.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.800
Mr. Mok.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.870
If Mok had stopped our men any later,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.170
he’d have been dead.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.730
Is this the surprise about you, Kian?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
Did that kid fall in love with
the perfume company owner,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.820
or the heir to the Lee family?

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.400
Peach loves me.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.410
He loves me for who I am.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650
Please take care of
the pretend mafia like Kian for me.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.350
Ugh, what’s that sound?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.380
Are you sure about this?

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.420
Won’t Mr. Peach be mad when he wakes up?

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.700
I’m doing this because I love him.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.410
I think Peach will understand.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.400
Be more gentle.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.050
All items must remain
in their original condition.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.900
Do not damage them.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.460
What’s going on?

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.340
Good morning.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.470
What are you doing to my house?

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.170
After days and nights
of thinking it through,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.400
I’ve made my decision.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.500
What’s that?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.400
You’re moving in with me
when we’re married, Lookpeach.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:51.350
What?!

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.700
You can’t just move stuff
in my house like this.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.200
I’m not moving your stuff.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.170
Then what are you doing?

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.970
Behind the ARSENI house,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.980
there’s a little over one rai
of open land.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.100
I’m just moving this house
into the same compound.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.010
Moving my house? What do you mean?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.210
Don’t worry, Mr. Peach.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.000
The team Mr. Thee chose

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.620
has moved an entire historic
wooden house across cities before.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.600
What?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.650
Rest assured.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.170
Only the location will change.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.750
Everything in this house
will remain the same.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.140
You’re moving my house?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.670
We’ll lift and move your entire house.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.200
If there are any trees
you’d like to take with you,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.350
just let me know.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.020
I’ll have them prepared for relocation.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.620
Stop!

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.170
Everyone stop!

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.650
Stay where you are!

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.200
I just want you to move your house
close to mine.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.060
I already moved here, didn’t I?

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.900
I brought all my essentials.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.450
You moved your stuff, not your house.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.650
Hey!

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.540
No one would be crazy enough
to move houses the way you wanted to,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.980
moving the entire house somewhere else.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.500
The Temple of Dendur was moved
across a continent from Egypt to America.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
I’m not mad.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.560
Don’t be so glum.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.870
I figured the house

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.600
is full of memories
of you and your sister.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.000
And you must’ve bought it
with your hard-earned money.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.820
If you move in with me here in the future,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.570
I don’t want you to have to sacrifice

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.600
or leave anything behind.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.100
I don’t care much about material things.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.250
If I actually moved out of that house,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.550
I could just go back and visit.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.000
I don’t mind.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.140
Thank you

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.400
for agreeing to move in with me.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.080
Hey.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.220
I only agreed to split my time
between this house and mine.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.420
Besides, I still have to
take care of Plub.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.700
I need some private time
with my sister too.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.100
Then let’s all move in together.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.000
How about we live here together
as a family?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.200
Mom’s always wanted a daughter,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.200
and Plub is a good girl.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.820
I think Mom will like her.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.540
That’s a big decision to make.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.600
Besides,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.700
let’s just ask Plub when we have a chance.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.270
I can’t decide for her.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.950
Don’t try to charm me like that.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.410
P’Kian.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.420
Do you wuv me, Lookpeach?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.000
Don’t try to charm me.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.220
I never thought
Kian would be this lovestruck.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.050
When did you arrive from Hong Kong?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.050
I missed you so much, so…

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.950
Wait.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.950
You look thinner.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.330
Make sure you’re eating.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.000
Don’t just work all the time.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.000
I’m about to graduate.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.500
Yes.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.800
Soon I’ll find out

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.500
which side of the world
I’ll have to move to.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.100
It could be nearby or very far away.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.400
Yes.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.030
Can you go with me?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.330
I can’t.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.770
Mok.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.850
I work for Mr. Thee.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.650
My job is here.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.600
I wasn’t trained to be
someone else’s right-hand man.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.220
Stop acting like your life
is not yours, will you?

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.500
But it’s not.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.990
What if you went with me as someone else,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.900
not my right-hand man,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.700
not someone who works for ARSENI?

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.370
Could we go together then?

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.900
Just tell me

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.000
if you feel anything.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.380
If you feel the same,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.770
I’ll take care of the rest.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.230
We can’t do that.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.500
Are you getting off work late today?

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.050
Do you want me to pick you up
so we can come home together?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.800
I think I’m going back
to my house tonight.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.800
I feel like I haven’t been
spending much time with Plub,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.300
so we planned a sleepover at my house.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.410
But if you’re free tonight, you can come—

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.130
I’m coming.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.470
It’s good you’re coming.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.400
I think I’m going to talk to Plub
about what Mom asked,

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.980
but I don’t know what she’ll say.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.000
Even though I don’t know Plub
as well as you do,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.150
I think I understand who she is.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.950
She must value her freedom
just as much as you do, Lookpeach.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.400
There’s no rush

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.650
to sign any adoption documents.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.430
I understand.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.650
Having a new family
is not easy for the two of you.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.140
Let’s focus only on the product,
not the setting.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.020
Hi.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.540
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.400
Coffee?

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.950
Thank you. You’re so kind.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.800
I’ll take these then.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.050
Hey,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.020
I heard you’ll be the main photographer
for the next project.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.000
Yes, but I still want to be your assistant.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.400
Be confident. You can do it.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.420
Oh, Peach, don’t talk about that.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.150
He’s been calling team meetings
twice a day,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.460
morning and evening, for a whole week now.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.760
How much more excited can he get?

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.500
I’m so sick of the references
I could throw up.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.900
Come on.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.800
Anyway, what are you doing here today,
Peach?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.500
I could make you sign our contract,
you know?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.650
Even if he didn’t sign,
he wouldn’t be able to run away.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.800
I saw who you were riding with
this morning.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.350
Oh?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.350
I was dropping my boyfriend off,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.350
so I thought I’d come up
and see my sister.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.570
Mmm.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.000
I’m just an extra these days.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.900
Just kidding.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.540
Hey, Peach.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.820
Wanna stay and have lunch together?

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.150
I have to go take care of something.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:56.970
Peach.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.630
Is everything okay?

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.000
Mother just called to tell me

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.530
someone wants to adopt Mork.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.800
Why is the world so unkind
to these siblings?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.950
One gets taken away, then the other.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.800
They never get to stay together.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.400
Yeah, that’s why I’m going to see them
before heading to my other job.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.400
Okay.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.300
Let me know how it goes.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.370
Mmm.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.490
Please excuse me.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.640
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.350
Bye-bye.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.100
Oh, look who’s all glum now.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.370
All emotional and sad.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.600
Shut up, Note.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.300
Wanna try me?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.300
Ran!

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.590
Oh!

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.850
Hi, Peach!

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.200
What are you doing here?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.500
To clear up some contract paperwork.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.050
How are you? It’s been a while.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.170
I’m good.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.200
Is that your new driver?

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.500
Roommate.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.850
Roommate?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.590
Yeah.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.900
Alright.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.900
It’s almost time for my meeting.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.690
I should get going.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.440
Okay.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.240
Let’s meet up soon.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.300
-See you.
-See you.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.600
Wait!

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.150
Can I talk to you, Mr. Peach?

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.500
Well…

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.300
I want to apologize to you again

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.800
for how badly I treated you all this time.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.250
I’m not asking for
your forgiveness or anything.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.250
I just want to say sorry
from the bottom of my heart.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.000
Let bygones be bygones.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.600
You’ve been given one last chance by Aran.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.740
Don’t waste it.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.700
And I’m sorry about your family.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.600
We have to live with
the consequences of our actions.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.330
Oh, okay.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.300
Sure.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.100
Plub!

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.310
Plub!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.300
What is it, Nuch?

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.700
Boss wants to see you urgently.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.080
Huh?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.200
Boss wants to see you urgently.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.520
Oh, hi, Mr. Mok.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.490
Hi, Ms. Plub.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.870
Is there some kind of emergency?

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.540
I have no idea.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.970
You’re his secretary.
How come you don’t know?

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.540
Let’s go inside and find out together.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.400
This is not as easy as I thought.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.770
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.650
I need more team members for this project.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.300
The Spring project?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.380
Or Summer?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.450
In every season ahead

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.610
our love

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.370
will shine.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.350
(How are things over there?)

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.450
Give me half an hour.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.700
Lookplub, it’s time to eat.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.700
Okay, Peach.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.020
I have to hang up
before Peach gets suspicious.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.390
I want to make it the grandest it can be.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.370
Do you think Peach will be impressed?

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.700
Uh…

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.100
Where’s Mr. Thee?

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.150
I thought he was joining us for dinner.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.600
He’s in a meeting,

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.450
so he told us to start eating without him.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.550
He’ll bring snacks later.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.050
Oh.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:37.220
Peach.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.500
Your hands are messy. Come on.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.270
Let me wipe them.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.250
It’s okay.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.900
Let me finish peeling all these first.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.900
I’ll wipe them afterward.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.490
Come on, Peach.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.450
Hmm?

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.090
What are you doing?

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.070
I’m wiping your hands.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.140
It’s okay. They’re dry now.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.390
Whoa.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.150
What did you do?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.650
Why is your hair so tangled?

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.450
I haven’t washed it, so it’s sticky.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.890
Ew.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:27.450
Take that.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.750
By the way,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.100
Tawan came to talk to me today.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.850
For what?

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.100
Did he do anything to you?

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.430
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.930
Does Mr. Thee know?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.330
He came to apologize.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.500
Can he be trusted?

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.580
Something could get into him,
and he could go crazy again any day.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.550
But I think
he really feels guilty this time.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.000
I don’t know.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.300
He seems defeated.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.450
He really is.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.700
He’s all alone.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.810
His family had to flee abroad.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.450
If Aran hadn’t adopted him,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.300
his life would definitely be worse.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.700
Don’t talk about him like that.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.700
Those two are dating.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.900
The Lee family is the real deal, though.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.750
I have to give it to Mr. Thee.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.400
Aren’t you scared of
the Lee family anymore?

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.900
I thought you told me
to stay away from him at all costs.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.950
I stopped being scared when Mr. Thee
treated me to that whole salmon.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.380
Do you want 10 more?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.450
I can have my chef
prepare them for you at home.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.400
♪ I’ll save them all for you ♪

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.540
I even get milk before bed.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.050
Mr. Thee, you make me feel like
Little Panachakorn again.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.420
Besides Lookpeach,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.100
you’re the other exception,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.800
the one I’ll prepare everything for,
like a princess.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.230
What a princess treatment.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:38.630
Plub.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.100
Ms. Natlada, Mr. Thee’s mother,
wants to invite you over for a meal.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.300
She’s inviting me too?

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.100
When she heard I have a younger sister,

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.900
she wanted to get to know you.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.950
Okay. I can go. No problem.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.150
Okay.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:12.900
Oh.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.400
Tell me about Mork.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.800
How was meeting him today?

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.870
Well, it was just like I thought.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.500
He didn’t want to go,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.290
but Mother had to follow the rules.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.060
What happened?

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.580
Someone wants to adopt Mork.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.600
Do you remember the boy we met together?

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.470
You know I have very few friends, Mim.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.630
I don’t cut ties with anyone so easily.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.800
I get it.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.100
Don’t worry.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.600
I understand everything.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.630
Okay. Let’s meet up sometime.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.600
See you.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.010
Mim called to tell me that
Shohei closed the company.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.310
Tatsuya has also fled back overseas

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.930
without saying goodbye to anyone,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.650
but at least he paid compensation
to his employees.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.890
Where’s your meet-up?

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.900
What meet-up?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.730
You’re meeting up with her.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.500
Where?

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.780
I’m coming with you.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.490
That was just a goodbye phrase.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.000
We’re not actually meeting up.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.150
Are you jealous?

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.200
Jealous?

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.650
Is this what it’s like to be jealous?

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.200
Well…

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.430
If you’re mad about your boyfriend
talking to his ex,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.650
you’re jealous.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.150
(My plan didn’t work.)

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.450
(Let’s move on to plan B.)

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.060
Such beautiful music.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.400
I love it so much

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.740
when you play this turtle shell.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.100
I want to hear that note.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.930
What about this one?

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.400
Aren’t you sore, reaching that far?

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.500
I’m right-handed.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.000
Alright.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.620
Enjoy playing.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.820
I really love this note.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.900
Can you tap it again?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.390
Okay. I’m good.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.080
♪ There’s no such thing as too much ♪

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.600
♪ All I do is for you ♪

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.000
I’d better sleep now.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.400
You never miss, do you, Mr. Thee?

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.980
Please let me know the size, Boss.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.800
I’m worried that if we don’t order now,
it won’t be ready in time.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.580
Okay?

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.150
Okay.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.400
What’s the size?

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.230
Don’t tell me…

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.200
Here it is.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.740
The size of Peach’s left ring finger.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.370
I measured it with my own hand.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.540
There’s no way it can be wrong.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.270
Ugh.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.350
There’s every way it can be wrong.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.000
Fine.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.300
Here’s what we’ll do.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.990
Get it made in every size.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.340
One ring per size.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.800
If he’d told me to do that
from the beginning,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.210
he’d be on his honeymoon by now.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.900
Mok!

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.620
You swear this is a house?

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.540
There you are.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.570
My beautiful daughter!

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.980
Hello.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.970
Hi.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.130
It’s such a shame that
Rome and Dad aren’t here.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.620
Otherwise, we’d all be together.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.110
You both look adorable.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.250
Seeing you makes me want to give you
a deed to a piece of land on Wireless Road.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.200
Sounds good?

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.130
Uh…

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:19.780
Mom.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.030
That land is so small.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.300
I think…

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.700
the one by the beach in Phuket

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.300
is more interesting.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.770
You’re right.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.100
I completely forgot.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.000
Oh, wait.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.500
What about our land on Ibiza?

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.930
Oh, yes.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.530
Ibiza.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.250
Yes, Ibiza.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.970
Are we playing Monopoly?

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.800
Those are deeds, not play money.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.170
Are we building landmarks now?

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.940
Are you sure it’s a good idea
to leave Plub with Mom?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.550
She just has to indulge Mom a little,

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.660
and she’ll get a million or two
as pocket money.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:18.850
Mr. Thee.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.470
Just kidding.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.650
We’ve been together for a while now.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.030
It’s not like I don’t know you.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.420
Trust my instincts.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.300
Mom and Lookplub will get along very well.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.000
I just want them to get along quickly.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.100
Peach!

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.620
Mom is so good at braiding hair.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.600
Look. This is like a flower crown.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.050
That’s so beautiful.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.660
Did Mom braid your hair?

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.000
Yes.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.300
You know what?

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.320
When I let her choose
from my entire designer bag collection

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.580
in my walk-in closet,

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.300
she pouted and kept saying
she wanted to go home.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.940
But she’s happy
just because I braided her hair.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.000
Do you get it now, Mom?

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.250
In this world,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.180
there are things our money can’t buy.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.180
I don’t even dare to sleep.
I’m afraid my hair will get messed up.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.140
Really?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.000
Yes.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.800
I don’t dare to wash my hair either.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.300
I think you’re just lazy.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.200
Wahh.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.450
You saw right through me.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.500

Do you like it?

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.150
I chose this place
because I know you’re an introvert.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.700
It’s not crowded here.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.500

promise to love and be faithful to you

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.350
in good times and in bad,

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.100
in sickness and in health.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.270
I’ll prepare only as much food as needed.

just throw it away.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.500

I’ll smile every time
you grab a camera to take photos.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.340
You have a beautiful smile.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.600
You should smile often.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.500
Smile at you.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.180
And I’ll really get a grip,
just like you always tell me to.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.530
I,

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.580
Peachayarat Jane-kit,

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.000
promise to love and be faithful to you.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:48.750
Also,

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.540
I won’t take the remote away from you,

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.500
no matter which soap opera
you want to watch.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.220
And I won’t laugh
when you say something weird.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.100
Why are you laughing?

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.300
To love and respect you
until death do us part.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.400
There’s still one more important gift
I want to give you.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.100
Isn’t this special enough?

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.380
Marn. Mork.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.370
How did you get here?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.850
Dad picked us up.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:53.420
Dad?

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.100
Thank you for helping me.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.860
I should be the one thanking you,
Mr. Theerakit.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.970
Because of you, these two kids
won’t have to be separated.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.390
If you need any help, just let me know.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.950
And to give back to the home
that raised Peach and Plub,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.050
ARSENI will take care of this place
and all the children’s scholarships.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.200
Thank you so much.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:22.860
Marn, Mork,

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.250
please thank him.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.900
Are you really adopting us?

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.200
Yes.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.050
You’re friends with Peach, right?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.050
I remember.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.050
No.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.670
I’m Peach’s partner.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.700
Even though I used money
to solve the problem

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.550
and bring Marn and Mork home,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.730
everything was done by the rules.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.730
I had to visit the children’s home
many times.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.050
I also had to get to know them
and familiarize myself with them.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.940
Being a father is not easy at all.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.800
Did you do all of that by yourself?

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.430
We’ll make sure these two kids
have a good life

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:14.700
like you and Lookplub.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.200
Thank you, truly, P’Kian.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.660
This doesn’t even reflect

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.030
a fraction of the burning desire
and care that I have for you, Lookpeach.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.050
Call me Daddy.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.600
It’s been so long since I last danced.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.700
I’m quite tired.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:48.100
It’s such an honor to have danced with
a timeless star like you, Ms. Natlada.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.800
The honor is mine.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.900
You’ve become the joy
of our family, Peach.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.100
My pleasure.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.950
You’re just the right person
to be Kian’s dance partner.

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.650
While true love is really hard to find,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.100
it doesn’t mean it can’t be found.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.900
Sometimes, you just have to
follow the rhythm.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.500
Even if something makes you stop,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.350
as long as you’re not afraid,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.260
you’ll finally be able to dance.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.200
Another song?

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.570
Of course.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.000
It would be my pleasure.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.330
You’ve destroyed every rule I made.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.400
I didn’t destroy them.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.900
I just want to live my life
like a normal person,

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.380
to throw a party and socialize

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.550
without worrying about anything again.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.450
You have done what I could never do.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.450
This place is starting
to feel nicer than mine.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.500
This place is ARSENI.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.980
It’ll always be your place, Dad.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.100
If you’re happy here,

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.840
come live with me.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.010
See? I told you.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.220
You can do it.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:17.750
It took me so long.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.100
I stepped on your feet so much
that your nails almost fell off.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.800
Thank you for taking the time to teach me.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.000
It’s chill.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.000
Why are you so good to me?

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.070
Being the youngest must’ve been nice.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.350
Aren't you afraid of
having that love taken away from you?

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.300
Let me tell you something.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.500
I really don’t want to be
the youngest child.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.090
The moment you showed up,
Mom stopped meddling in my life.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.800
I’m so happy, honestly.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.850
Poor people want to be rich.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.170
Rich people want to
run away from their lives.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:51.700
It’s straight out of a soap opera.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.900
If you knew what I have to
deal with in my life,

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.250
you wouldn’t say that.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.850
And you might even want to
help me run away.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.330
It’s not like I don’t know.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.200
Like the thing with Mr. Mok.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:07.900
Do you want me to help you?

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.100
Ouch!

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.150
Oh.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:13.630
Sorry.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.050
Let’s try again.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.190
You do want my help, right?

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.650
Everything is going well, Boss.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.010
Today is your day off, Mok.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:36.950
I’m sorry.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.950
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.140
I’m so happy for you, Mr. Thee.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.450
Say it as a friend.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:55.600
I…

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:59.900
I’m so happy for you, dude.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:20.970
A notice of separation?

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.400
Mr. Thee, I’m sorry if I’ve offended you,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:27.880
but if you’re upset,
please just reprimand me.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.700
You’re fired.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.730
You’ll receive 10 years’ compensation.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.200
-This is not funny.
-We did it.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.670
It’s safe enough
to live a normal life here now.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.330
I’m asking you to finally go live a life
that makes you happy.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:51.800
I’m begging you

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.450
as a friend.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.500
Oh.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:21.850
Too bad.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.050
You’ve lost your job.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.940
Calm down, Mr. Rome.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.600
You’ve been smiling all day.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.980
Doesn’t your face get tired?

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.780
It feels like a dream

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.450
to have you here in front of me.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.350
If this really is a dream,

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:27.950
then I don’t want to wake up.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:34.470
Thank you so much
for coming into my ordinary life

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.000
and making it so meaningful.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.700
I should be the one thanking you.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.030
I want you to be
the luckiest person in the world,

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.650
but it turns out I’m the luckier one.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.400
Lookpeach,

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.700
If I wanted to ask you for a kiss…

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.400
Children can’t watch.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.670
Let’s go.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.510
What’s Dad doing with Peach?

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.640
It’s Peach who did it to Dad first.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.550
They’re just talking.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.250
Mr. Mok told me
you didn’t like fruity scents, P’Kian.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.450
I changed my mind when I met you.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.100
I’m just called Peach, but that has
nothing to do with the peach scent.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.800
Isn’t this a bit too much?

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.550
This is the scent I like

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.100
and want to wear for the rest of my life.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.250
What scent?

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.200
Even though I’m very kind

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.220
and I love you very much,

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.350
I still have my wolf tattoo.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.200
So,

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.970
don’t look at me
with those eyes, Lookpeach.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:53.230
Don’t say I didn't warn you.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:51.350
We’re married,

00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:58.810
so I won’t ask.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:05.830
You’re mine now.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:11.720
Peach!

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.050
Peach!

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.920
Dad!

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.670
Dad!

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.600
Go open the door.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.300
Why did you two come to sleep here?

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:30.240
Uncle Rome said
tonight is your and Dad’s wedding night.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.250
It’s a very fun night,

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.540
so Mork and I wanted to come
play with you.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:38.400
I think it’s getting late.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.450
Let’s sleep, shall we?

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.000
Come here.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.430
Come.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.400
Good night.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.940
Love you.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:09.820
Love you too.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.650
Okay.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:17.950
Come on, everyone.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.660
(These are ways to spoil your partner
if you have an unlimited budget.)

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.660
This keyword again.

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:53.250
Haven’t you already done
everything the AI told you?

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:55.800
There might be new updates.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:00.900
Hold a private concert.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.100
I’ve even written a song for you
with my own hands.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.000
So that’s too basic.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.800
Anything more special than that?

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.700
Buy a private island.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.600
Land deeds with your name

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.850
are stacked in the safe.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.700
Buy your partner a star.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.800
So basic.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.150
I’ll give you one more chance.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.750
If it’s still not interesting,

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.100
I’ll take over your company

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.810
and fire everyone.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.400
Make a series about you and your partner.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.250
Interesting.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.240
Isn’t that too difficult?

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.860
Hello, Mr. Sataporn.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.230
(Hello, Mr. Thee.)

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.110
The country’s number-one
series production company

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.660
you’re running right now,

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.130
would you sell it?

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.150
I’ll buy it.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:53.330
(Are you serious?)

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.200
Yes.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:56.100
I’ll buy it all.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.090
Rest assured, Mr. Sataporn.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.270
I may not yet be able to show you
my love for the company,

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:08.450
but I promise

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.670
to take the best care of it.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.600
Mr. Thee, Mr. Tha,

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:13.900
look this way, please.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:19.100
What will the future of
GMM THEE V look like?

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.600
Let’s hear it from our big boss.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.850
As long as my breath belongs here,

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.500
I’ll make sure GMM THEE V
is filled with nothing but light

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.000
that no one can put out.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:29.930
Never.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.330
You’re Director Nuttapong Mongkolsawas?

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.170
Yes, sir.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.400
I’ve prepared the script for you.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.180
Go produce my story.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.580
What should the leading man be like?

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:49.980
Of course, he has to be handsome,

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:50.780
tall,

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:51.540
and have a great body.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.600
Most importantly,

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:54.200
he has to be very lean.

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:55.580
When would you like it to air?

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.100
As soon as my heart desires.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.000
If you take too long,

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.800
I’ll definitely crush you to pieces.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:50.350
-Mr. Thee.
-Mr. Thee.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.300
Have you eaten?

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.120
Hey, that’s Mr. Thee!

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.550
-Mr. Thee!
-Hello, Mr. Thee.
