00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.000
Gu Yixiao,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.400
I've figured it out.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.480
Since you won't let me go,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.960
and I'm destined to stay by your side,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800
then maybe starting now,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.960
I'll try to like you.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.720
Really?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.440
You're so obedient?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.440
What trick are you playing this time?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.720
I'm not playing any tricks on you.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.680
After what happened last night,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.640
I'm exhausted.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.480
I don't want to fight anymore.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.840
I just want life to be a little better.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.800
Gu Yixiao,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.840
if I learn to behave well,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.250
can you treat me better?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.520
Sure. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.040
Then let me see

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.160
how well you can behave.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.040
What's wrong?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.000
Getting scared now?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.640
That's a pity.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600
I don't like you at all.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.200
Gu Yixiao,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.240
I know you like Xingyue.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.960
She's sweet,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.080
sensible,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.600
and obedient.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.960
But before I met you,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.640
I was just like that too.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.080
Ye Xingwan,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.240
don't use the tricks
you play on those men

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.880
to deal with me.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.840
Go ahead.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.080
What's your goal this time?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.280
I'm serious this time.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.680
I don't want to be your socialite

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.550
used to curry favor
with the powerful anymore.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.880
I actually want to do real work.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.550
You want to get involved in my business?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.120
I want you to see what I'm capable of.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.760
What I can offer you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.480
is way more than you think.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.160
I know the company's been planning

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.160
an acquisition of an e-sports club.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.850
I can help you with that.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.640
I'll think about it.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.880
Then I'll stay here for now.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.600
(Wang Yaqin was right.)

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.740
(To win someone over,
to win their heart.)

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.480
(This round,)

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.000
(I won.)

(Access restricted:
You have no permission)

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.880
(So this acquisition isn't
as simple as it looks.)

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.000
(But where should I)

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.520
(get this internal data?)

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.920
Don't be in such a rush.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.920
He's not so foolish

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.040
to let you just easily

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.800
find those key details.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.380
Anyway,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.420
I still want to thank you.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.680
Otherwise, I wouldn't have noticed

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.560
this acquisition plan.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.720
I have looked into a lot of information

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.560
and found no issues with this plan.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.080
So,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.880
the only explanation I can think of

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.160
is money laundering.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.920
I've heard

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320
about Xu Dashan's matter.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.960
I've looked into you, Wang Yaqin.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.920
Ever since Gu Group was founded,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.990
you've been here all along,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.120
doing the toughest and dirtiest jobs.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.320
But you never leaves this building.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.520
You even sleep in the storage room.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.800
What kind of grudge
do you have against him?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.080
That's none of your concern.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Since

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.440
you've already moved
into Gu Yixiao's villa,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.760
that proves what I said was right.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280
Ever since I moved in,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.520
he hasn't come back once.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.400
He's always been a cautious man.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.680
For him,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.400
you need to be more patient.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.480
You're just a cleaner,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.120
yet you know so much

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.550
about what happens around Gu Yixiao.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.600
You're trying to get back at him.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.240
Otherwise, why would you help me?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.320
That doesn't matter.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.960
I'm helping you

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.520
because I don't want to see him
keep making mistakes.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.800
Maybe,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.550
you can actually save him.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.320
Miss Ye,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.600
you know, between people,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.280
there's more than just hate and pain.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.480
Try opening his heart.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.040
Then you'll see a softer side

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.720
inside him.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.000
If everything you said is true,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.200
wouldn't that softness be his weakness?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.880
Since you seem to know him so well,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.440
can you tell me

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.440
what he actually likes?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.720
Mr. Chu,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.920
you told me

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.200
I could get Miss Ye.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.160
But I ended up risking half my life.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.730
And we're just letting that go?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.640
Mr. Xu,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.880
this time, it was my fault.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.260
This has nothing to do with Mr. Gu.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.000
I'll make up for your losses.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.320
Miss Ye,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.120
I've been looking for you.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.760
What do you want from me, Mr. Chu?

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.410
This is the acquisition proposal.

(E-sports Club Acquisition Proposal)

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.250
Mr. Gu asked me to give it to you.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.480
Don't be so proud.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.160
This is just the beginning.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.680
What do you mean by that, Mr. Chu?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.520
Stop pretending it.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.400
I know exactly what's on your mind.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.880
And I know what you're planning to do.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.560
Right back at you.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.630
If I told him about your plotting

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.490
with Xu Dashan,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.600
what do you think

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.640
he would do?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.400
Then I'll keep a close eye on you.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.480
Let's wait and see.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.720
You know who I am?

Winner of the LVP National Finals.

Hot favorite
for the next world championship.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.880
A true prodigy.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.040
I'm the secretary of Gu Group,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.240
Ye Xingwan.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
We need to talk in private.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.800
What do you mean by that?

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.020
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.400
Our group plans to acquire your team.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.740
Winning isn't the only goal.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.560
There's also a business purpose
behind it.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.600
As the captain,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.570
you'll need to help us
recruit new talent,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.480
and expand the lineup.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.680
As for our financial accounts,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.160
during the review,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.040
just keep quiet, alright?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.760
You're breaking the law.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.880
Why do you think I'd help you guys?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.000
If you have any terms, just say them.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640
You want money

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800
or something else?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.240
What if I say no?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.720
I don't want the team
I built from scratch

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.960
to become someone's tool.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.040
Don't be so sure just yet.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.080
Human nature cannot withstand tests.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.040
When you say that,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.550
you're basically admitting our offer

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.600
wasn't tempting enough.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.600
Is that so?

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.990
So how much temptation
are you going to give me?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200
What if I say

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.600
what I want is you?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.440
So young,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.360
yet with quite a lot of ideas.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.840
I never imagined

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.380
the person who once got into
Donghua University's Faculty of Law,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.160
determined to become a lawyer,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.680
would now be asking me
to commit a crime with her.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.360
How do you know?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.960

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560
