00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.530
Once.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.700
Twice.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.060
Three times.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.770
After the third time,

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.820
they all left.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.460
Maybe the novelty wore off.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.370
A life like mine, with nothing at all,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.700
is like a bottomless pit.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.650
No matter what I do, it changes nothing.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.370
They were all good people.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.980
Anyone who helps you three times

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.460
is a good person.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.610
Many would not even help once.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.490
I have no right to pity you.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.730
My life

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.010
is not any better than yours.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.820
I only want a life that is calm and steady.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.460
Even a wish this small

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.370
feels impossible to reach.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.820
So I am not feeling sorry for you.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.730
I genuinely want to thank you.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.300
You were right earlier.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.250
About the e-commerce gift cards,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.220
it was Gu Chen.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.250
If it were not for you,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.530
I would have been pushed out long ago.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.620
What do you plan to do next?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.490
What else can I do?

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.290
Quit.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.530
Why quit?

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.220
If giving it everything still fails,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.730
then go all in and break it wide open.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.050
Go report him to the Chairman.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.220
It is not that simple.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.700
The moment you expose him,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.730
you splash filth all over yourself too.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.090
There will be no good ending.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.180
But you did nothing wrong.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.810
The guilty ones

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.250
are the ones who should be punished.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.570
That is just how life is.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.420
We come into this world

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.010
to suffer for it.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.050
Do you want me to take him out for you?

Paralysis in the lower limbs.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.530
Unable to care for daily needs.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.380
As for the elderly person's children,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.460
have they all passed away?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.700
They fled over debts ten years ago.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.050
There has been no news since.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.620
Caring for the elderly alone

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.810
must be very hard.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.770
We will review the materials as soon as possible.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.860
Within five business days,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:10.980
you will receive our response.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.900
Chairman.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.180
In addition to the on-site medical center,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.940
we have also brought in nutritionists.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.180
Based on each resident's condition,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.180
we tailor meal plans.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.670
Those admitted free of charge

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.700
are treated exactly the same.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.490
Yes.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.460
We do not give differential treatment.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:30.900
You can rest assured.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.900
Chairman.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.250
It is a bit chilly out here.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.380
Please wait a moment.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.010
Get me a jacket.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.330
No need.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.940
Please put something on.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.420
That will be all for today.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.660
You can head back.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.940
I will come again next time.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.730
Let me ask you.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.050
You and Jiang Jiaqi,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.420
what exactly is going on?

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.700
You had better explain it clearly yourself.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.770
I do not want

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.290
to hear it from someone else.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.010
Mainly because

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.620
I contacted his wife privately.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.810
He misunderstood it a bit.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.010
About Director Jiang,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.810
and his wife,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.420
we were all schoolmates in college.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.220
Last time,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.010
because of the gift card bribery,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.700
she was worried about him,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.730
so she came to me.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.010
She told me

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.490
Director Jiang is not that kind of person.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.140
He would never do something like that.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.770
We used to be close,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.290
so I wanted to believe him.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.420
We talked a few times.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.180
You know

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.420
about this too, Chairman.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.420
It's a sensitive matter,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.700
and it involves company business.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.250
So it really is not appropriate

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.770
for me to bring it up with Director Jiang.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.660
As for his wife,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.900
why did she not tell him herself?

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.570
My guess is,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.900
she was afraid he would get angry.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.900
After all, Director Jiang

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.010
has never liked me.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.220
Why?

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.810
Was it not him who

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.730
recommended you to his mentor?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:54.810
Yes.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.530
His mentor

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.140
thought highly of me back then.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.490
It could be

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.380
because of that.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.330
When you are in the same field,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.460
comparisons come easily.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.770
Director Jiang's grades back then

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.620
were better than mine.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.090
He also carried himself with more pride.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.420
Later on I pulled ahead,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.940
and in school I outshone him everywhere.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.290
And then, by sheer irony,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.330
once we entered the working world,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.530
I ended up as his boss.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:21.980
True.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.860
Anyone would feel bitter about that.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.220
Well,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.900
that is understandable.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.490
Chairman.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.980
For the sake of the company,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.090
I truly did not want

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:32.770
things to stay this way.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.010
So I thought

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.330
I would swallow my pride

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.420
and take the initiative to make peace.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.010
I never expected this outcome.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.530
Fine. I will remember this lesson.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.090
That is enough.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.730
You and Wang Licheng

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.860
discuss it properly.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.810
The position Pang Jian left

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.290
needs a replacement as soon as possible.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.140
Rest assured.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.090
Here.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.620
All right. I will be going.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.620
Take care.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.090
I have been waiting for your update.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.810
I called you and you did not answer.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.570
All these days,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.010
not even a single call back.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.090
If you say you saw nothing,

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.090
I do not believe it.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.860
I am sorry.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.660
There have been many things at home lately.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.730
Did you not ask me before

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.180
about Gu Chen's complex address?

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.980
What were you trying to confirm back then?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.530
I must have been mistaken.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.570
What did you see

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.900
that made you think you were mistaken?

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.140
In short, I did not see anything useful.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.980
Are you sure?

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.010
Did you bring those photos?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.730
Let me see them again.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.380
I threw them away.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.380
Why?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.420
The Inspection Office searched my desk earlier.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.250
They almost discovered them.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.620
In the panic,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.420
I disposed of them.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.460
Jiang Jiaqi.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.290
Have you lost your nerve?

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.330
Think whatever you want.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.090
I just do not want

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.010
to keep digging into this.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.420
Do not say I did not warn you.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.900
Unless you side with Gu Chen,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.180
this war is only just beginning.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.860
I heard about what happened at the company dinner.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.250
You two have already

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.250
fallen out completely, right?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.420
Only one of you can survive.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.810
Are you really willing to be eliminated like this?

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.010
What if you could vote him out

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.330
fair and square?

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.860
When you recommended it to me before,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.980
I thought it was boring.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.330
Now the more I watch, the better it gets.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.530
Let us watch a few more episodes tonight.

I want to discuss something with you.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.180
You know the old man

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.330
has been dealing with

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.660
this voting matter lately.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.220
A lot of people are watching me.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.250
If we keep meeting so often,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.380
I am afraid there could be risks.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.490
So?

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.380
So I was wondering

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.180
if we could stop seeing each other for a while.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.250
For a while?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.250
How long is that?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.770
I do not know.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.140
What about phone calls?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.250
If something urgent comes up,

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.180
of course you can call.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.570
Urgent?

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:06.380
I have to go.

It is so late. Where are you going?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.940
To see the old man.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:14.940
Wait.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.700
At this hour,

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.050
do you really need to go whenever he calls?

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.620
I have no choice.

Did you not ask me before

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.180
about Gu Chen's complex address?

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.980
What were you trying to confirm then?

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.900
I must have been mistaken.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.980
In short, I did not see anything useful.

You got pretty lucky.

Looks like he has made up his mind

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.770
to keep your affair with his wife buried.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.490
If so, it will not pose a threat to you.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.570
Then let us end it here.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.660
What if he changes his mind?

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.900
Or gets drunk and starts talking?

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.420
You still have to keep listening.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.180
Do I look that idle to you?

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.660
You will not be doing it for nothing.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.770
Since you have been listening,

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.860
you should already know

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.010
we clashed at the camp.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.180
Why did you not mention it?

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.860
Clashed?

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.050
Was that not just you

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.140
getting taught a lesson?

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.250
Do you really want me

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.940
to remind you again about something that embarrassing?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.380
Then his investigation into Yunxi Residence,

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.770
you knew about that too, right?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.330
He probably found it

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.380
by staking out Yunxi Residence.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.290
But how he got

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.300
a lead on Yunxi Residence,

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.250
I cannot figure out either.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.660
I did not hear him mention it to anyone on the recording.

No.

he would treat you to a meal,
