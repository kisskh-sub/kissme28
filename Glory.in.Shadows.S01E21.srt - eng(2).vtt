Jingchuan.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560
Just admit your mistake to Father.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510
Why? I've done nothing wrong.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.350
Kneel.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.790
Hit him.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.840
Hit him hard.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.320
Father.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.350
Father.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.230
Stop it, Father.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.150
I beg you, please stop.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.280
Stop hitting him.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.760
If we don't curb his arrogance now,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.350
how will I manage him in the future?

Get up, now.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.750
If you want to hit me, fine.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.520
Consider it repaying your care
in raising me.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.190
But if you dare lay a hand on Yaochu,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.500
don't blame me for shattering

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.630
what little bond we have left.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.750
You'd turn on your own father

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.400
for such a woman?

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.750
Have you no respect for me?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.730
A father's kindness
breeds a son's respect.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.910
You once vowed to my mother,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.360
yet soon after, you cast us aside.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.280
That is heartless.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.800
Zhao Qingru has guarded
your family for years.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.870
Yet you abandoned her.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.870
That is dishonorable.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.560
A man so cold and ungrateful as you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.360
is not worthy of being my father.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.240
I'm not worthy?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.590
Li Jingchuan.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.240
Do you believe I'd kill you?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.120
With your influence,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.360
can you even kill me?

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.310
Dear,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.170
this time, I'm here for you.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.040
Your father hit you today

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.170
just to force you into casting me aside.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.040
Even if this hadn't happened,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.100
he would've found a way
to punish me anyway.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.310
I know you were shielding me.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.230
And what about you?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
You took the lash for me.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.880
It must have hurt.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.200
Yes.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.070
My body is wounded.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.270
But my heart is finally healing.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.070
If I hadn't met you,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.830
the pain in my heart

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.480
might never have eased in this lifetime.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.710
And you?

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.240
Would you tell me
about the pain in your heart?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.660
- My mother was sold into a brothel.
- I feel cold.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.710
That place held her captive
for half her life.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.160
She entrusted her heart to Li Hongshan.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.630
But all she received
was deceit and abandonment.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.750
And because she was carrying me,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.570
she was cast out of the brothel.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.150
My mother knew her days were numbered.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.360
She feared I'd be left alone.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.830
(Li Manor)
So, she brought me to Li Manor,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.750
begging Li Hongshan to acknowledge me.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.870
I can no longer protect you.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.160
But if your father accepts you,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.120
I can die

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.310
without regret.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.160
No, I don't want you to die.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.660
- For his reputation,
- Please don't die.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.430
Li Hongshan took me in.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.360
Our fates are so much alike.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.110
Still,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.320
though we've faced countless hardships,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.730
we both found our way through.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.000
Right?

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.500
(Stability Ensures Peace)

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.930
This Fragrant Concubine Treading on Snow
came from Xingwan.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.200
The scent really is identical.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.190
Is Xingwan truly the murderer?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.040
If it were Shopkeeper Liu and Qin Ruoyi,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.510
she does seem suspicious.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.430
But on the day my mother died,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.340
she stayed with you the whole time.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.180
When would she have had time
to kill someone?

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.110
That's not right.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.480
She wasn't with me the whole time.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.730
She said she'd pick morning dew
to make tea.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.480
So she left early.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.350
When I arrived at Guanyin Nunnery,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.520
she was already there waiting.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.750
Jingchuan,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.160
why join me at the nunnery

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.720
to offer prayers?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.880
I had nothing else to do,
so I came for a stroll.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
Why didn't you bring Yaochu along?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.830
I see.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.120
What do you mean?

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.950
You're such a fool.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.000
You really think I killed your mother?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.720
If that's the case,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.390
Xingwan would be the prime suspect.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.240
In this household,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.360
I keep my guard up with everyone,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.110
except Xingwan.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
Whenever she appeared,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.340
she always made me feel

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.120
she was pure and kind-hearted.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.630
But if it was all just an act,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.800
that would be truly frightening.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.160
Xingwan was taken in before I returned.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.150
Zhao Qingru had just given birth
to Li Jingxu

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.390
and nearly died in childbirth.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.040
She kept a young girl nearby
to bring some joy,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.040
but since she wasn't a real Li,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.830
she was bullied everywhere she went.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.220
So, she followed me from a young age.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.070
In my eyes,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.120
she had always been timid and weak.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.510
Was that just a disguise?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.160
I must've overlooked something.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.000
In such a scheming household,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120
she grew up safely.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.000
How could she be simple?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.340
But she bore no grudge
against my mother.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.780
Why would she want her dead?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.480
Why don't we just ask her?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.320
Wait.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.150
Right now, our only lead is the scent.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.360
If Xingwan really did it,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.030
she could easily claim
that Concubine Tang is slandering her

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.540
and refuse to admit it.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.030
If it wasn't her,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.910
wouldn't that harm your bond
as siblings?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.840
Besides, the Fan Scorpion Poison
hasn't been found.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.910
Let's not alert her just yet.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.940
Then what should we do now?

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.920
Find someone

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.440
to follow her quietly.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.750
Let's see if she does
anything suspicious

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.230
and check

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.910
whether she really has
the Fan Scorpion Poison.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.630
Alright.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.920
Wait.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.040
General.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.680
What's inside here?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
This...

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.790
It's a calming potion.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.510
My lady hasn't been sleeping well.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.200
So, we asked a physician to prepare it.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.560
Go on.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.680
Yes.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.800
Jingchuan.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800
Jingchuan.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.790
I saw your maid take medicine out.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.960
Why?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.940
Are you feeling unwell?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.960
I've been waking up suddenly at night.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.480
So, I drank some calming potion.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.320
It's nothing serious.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.600
Jingchuan,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.630
has your injury healed?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.200
I was just about to visit you.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.630
It's fine.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.230
Jingchuan,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.240
I know you don't like Father.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.630
But what Father said

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.440
does make some sense.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.590
Xingwan,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.870
you should know

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.750
Yaochu and I love each other.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.550
I'd never cast my wife aside
for ambition.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.680
Jingchuan,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.000
you and Yaochu are so sweet.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.590
My Lady!

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.110
My Lady,

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.560
the Master has asked for you.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.870
Understood.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.440
Does he call you over every day?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.840
Father just woke up

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.750
and was met
with sudden troubles at home.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.080
It's left him troubled.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.600
He's asked me to speak with him often.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.710
Go on then.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.440
What's this?

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.720
I followed Zhenzhu all the way.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.080
I saw her toss the leftover herbs
in a hidden spot

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080
and step on them to bits.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.930
I picked the remnants back up

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.260
and went to consult a physician.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.560
The potion turned out to be...

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.350
Tell us.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.970
It was a contraceptive potion.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.440
My Lady,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.840
that potion is bad for your health.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.630
Shall I fetch the physician
to examine you?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.870
Do you want everyone

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.720
to know about my shame?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.630
I would never dare.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.470
Leave at once.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.650
Only when pain cuts deep into the bones

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.030
can hatred last forever.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.390
Why would she drink such a thing?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.120
Could it be she...

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.120
This matter must never be revealed.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.350
Yes.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.750
Leave.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.540
She rarely socializes with anyone.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.800
How could that be?

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.030
Given the situation,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.660
they've been in contact
for quite some time.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.960
Even if she was secretly seeing someone,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.750
why would she kill someone?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.710
That depends

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.030
on who her lover is.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.980
(Qifang Pavilion)

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.160
These past few days,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.000
she hasn't reached out
to anyone outside?

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.670
I've been following her.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.090
I even checked everything
going in and out of her room,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.500
but found nothing suspicious.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.280
Could it be

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.450
that this person is inside the manor?

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.870
Wait...

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.390
What is it?

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.110
Impossible.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.420
That's absolutely impossible.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.020
