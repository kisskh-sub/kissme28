00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.949
- In-su?
- Yes?

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.244
- Here's today's script.
- Please get a shot of Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.548
I'll leave a note.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.316
When I heard
we'd be visiting an opera house,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.443
I really wanted to try these seats.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.612
Do you like operas?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.572
I haven't seen many.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:58.243
But there's a scene in this movie I like,
where they go to the opera.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.955
Do you know Pretty Woman,
the movie with Julia Roberts?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.542
I do know that movie.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.961
But wasn't that way before your time?

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.004
You're right. It was.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.591
The male character in that movie
is super wealthy,

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.594
so they see the opera
in the most expensive seats.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.179
Just like these.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.224
That's why I've always wanted to try
sitting in them.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.233
Find out which opera
was in the movie Pretty Woman.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.569
- Please look it up.
- Okay.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.404
Let's play it as soon as it's ready.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.738
La Traviata.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.580
In that movie,
they go to see Verdi's La Traviata.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.796
This music plays again at the end,
in the movie's happiest scene.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.818
Amami, Alfredo.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.863
Quant'io t'amo.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.407
Quant'io t'amo.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:21.826
Addio.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.954
What was that? Was it Italian?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.289
Was it? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.874
Yeah, they're opera lyrics.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.002
So she memorized them?

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.045
What do they mean?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.507
Love me, Alfredo,

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.386
as much as I love you.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.310
Good… bye?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.238
Love me, Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.291
as much as I love you.

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:14.629
Goodbye.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:22.762
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.475
{\an8}TEN DAYS AGO, JAPAN

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.828
Aya-chan, you're brilliant!

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.665
Uncle Hiro's been studying lately too.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.709
I'm learning Korean.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.381
Come find me. I'll be waiting.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.092
If only I hadn't understood her.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.512
But your uncle is so smart
that he couldn't help it.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:16.065
I'm not the kind of guy who meets someone
simply because they ask me to.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.493
Thank you.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.664
She's one rude woman.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.042
Kissing me without permission.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:38.171
If she wanted to meet up,
she should have said when and where.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.714
Now I'm waiting anxiously.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.222
Aya-chan.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.101
Maybe I've been infected
by a zombie virus.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.233
So, are you flying to Italy today?

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.695
I just came to give Aya-chan her gift.
Then I'll head to the airport.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.530
How thoughtful.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.991
And how was the shoot? Did you like?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.037
Why would I like a zombie?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.414
And those dates are strictly work.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.626
It's not like
I'm actually interested in her.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:21.005
I was asking whether you liked Canada.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.800
I wasn't asking if you liked that woman.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.012
What's with you?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.933
They kissed.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.563
No. Honestly, it's not like that.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.566
That zombie caught me off guard.
That's all.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.653
I see. And I'm guessing
you fell for her too.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.489
Your first love.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.784
The older girl
who was the neighborhood rebel.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:51.911
Like Do Ra-mi.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.122
Why would you bring that up?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.165
It was the talk of the town.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.835
The romance between the rebel girl
and the pretty boy.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.839
Do we have a Korea-Japan scandal
on our hands this time?

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.674
This should be fun.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.759
- This should be fun!
- Right?

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:21.190
Maybe the pretty boy
has fallen for a zombie this time.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.363
CHA MU-HEE

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.823
I'll be waiting.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.175
You're really here this time.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:49.677
Hiro?

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:56.476
Did we come here together?

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.522
We've been together all along?

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:33.012
I was here alone, not with Hiro.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.184
RECENTS
YONG-U

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:41.854
I haven't been in touch
with anyone in particular.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.066
MESSAGES

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:45.983
I'LL BE WAITING

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.569
I really did text Hiro.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.410
I guess Do Ra-mi summoned him here.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:05.002
Then… what he said about me kissing him…

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.614
You asked me to come,
but you don't look happy to see me.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.117
Piecing everything together…

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.247
it seems as though I came on to you,

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.167
which is why you came all this way.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:48.337
In any case,

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.593
these very fingers sent you that text,

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:56.721
and with these…

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:01.058
I made a move on you.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.063
So fine. I'll take responsibility.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.023
"Responsibility"?

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.402
Which is why I need to know…

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.865
Do you like me?

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:34.759
I guess my showing up here
gave you the wrong impression.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.094
I only came here to confirm something.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.599
I came to see if you had lied again,
and to teach you a lesson if so.

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:45.311
Does that mean

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:48.064
you don't like me?

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:48.981
No.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.399
I don't like you.

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:52.985
Thank goodness.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.029
That's such a relief.

00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:58.741
Of course. There's no way you'd like me
when I know how much you hate me.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.619
Sorry for asking you
such a silly question.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:04.372
"Sorry"?

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.999
If I'm honest,

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.670
I had been debating
whether to come to Italy.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.090
Had I not run into you
as soon as I arrived,

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.635
I might have just flown back.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.308
Thank you for coming to meet with me.

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:26.435
Thank you.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.687
"Thank you"?

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:31.649
In light of what has happened,
I'll work even harder from now on.

00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:33.442
I'll do my best. Absolute best!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.491
You.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.328
Do you like me?

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.165
Not at all, no.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:54.964
I don't pick fights I can't win.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.926
I'd be losing by liking you
when you don't like me back.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:00.970
I will never lose!

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.097
We've got this!

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.266
We've got this!

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.643
- Yeah.
- We've got this!

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.478
That's what I'm saying. We've got this!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.646
We've got this!

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.025
We should go.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:18.404
Wait, no. I'll pay.

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:22.324
In Korea, the person who asks to meet
usually pays the bill.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.909
I guess you could call it

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.412
a Korean rule of sorts. Okay?

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.376
What?

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.384
But how…

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:41.969
Here you go.

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:50.102
I'm sorry that my card didn't work.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:51.979
I'm sorry.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:58.235
And thank you for offering me a ride
since my phone is also dead.

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.322
Thank you.

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:11.832
Let's go.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.526
Hello.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:39.819
- Hello.
- Hello!

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.530
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey, there!

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:46.158
- The front-facing camera is ready.
- Let's get a wide shot…

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:59.463
Hiro. I have today's schedule.
Could you take a look?

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.216
Looks like you'll have a lot of downtime.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.802
Shall we do a costume change
and touch-up here?

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:14.937
Mu-hee, your earpiece.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.772
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.069
Will you be in
Director Kim Jae-yeong's new movie?

00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:23.571
How did you know?

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:26.115
It's not decided yet.
I'm still reading the script.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.701
I'm part of the crew.
It would be great to work together.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.703
You are? I would love that.

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:31.871
It would be awesome.

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:33.789
- Are we good?
- Yes, looks good.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.383
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, can you hear me?

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.098
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.022
Yes, I can hear you.

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:00.774
The weather's great for our first day.

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.364
I heard that good weather on the first day

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.617
means clear skies for the entire shoot.

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.787
You'll continue to have good luck
the entire time you're in Italy.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.582
Thank you.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.753
Thanks in advance for your help, Mr. Joo.

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:46.111
Cameras, stand by.

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:57.122
All right, let's begin the Italy leg
of the Romantic Trip shoot.

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:02.336
Our new chapter in Italy has begun.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.173
Looks like Do Ra-mi
wore this out last night.

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.989
And bought this hat.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.048
"Lemoncello"?

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.301
Is that a lemon liqueur?

00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.637
She went out drinking?

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:41.935
Are you okay?

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:43.937
I'm okay.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.399
I had a few drinks last night.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.369
They say this entire place was a bathhouse
a long time ago.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.040
What is that?

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.503
In Korea, you buy snacks
when you go to a bathhouse.

00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:11.507
Have you heard of jjimjilbang?

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.966
- Mix.
- Together.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.010
- Mix.
- Mix.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.179
- Yay! Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:26.772
Sure, they were awkward in Canada,
but Mu-hee was all aflutter.

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:30.359
And there was this unspoken tension
with Hiro stealing glances.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.693
But now

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:35.781
they seem like two travel reporters
who are best buddies.

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:37.533
Don't they?

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.745
What changed? Maybe they're too friendly
with each other now.

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:42.830
You think so?

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:47.251
By the way, will Mr. Joo be staying
somewhere else for the entire trip?

00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.087
I'm just thinking we should reimburse him.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.881
He said he's staying at a friend's place
while they're away.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.508
He said not to worry about it.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:00.055
It's because you kept asking him
for all sorts of trivial favors.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.932
He's staying elsewhere to avoid you.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.686
Poor Mr. Joo.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.148
Couldn't be bothered, so he avoided…
That's how it is?

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.146
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.856
We're closed. I'm sorry.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:51.773
Just one drink.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.400
Not tonight.

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:54.443
Why?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.028
- Come back tomorrow.
- Hey, why…

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:01.700
Hey!

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:02.951
Hi!

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:17.507
These tasted so good.

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.440
Thank you.

00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:34.441
Well done.

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:39.071
Hey, babe!

00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:56.797
I was hoping for a quiet night,

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:58.715
but you're back.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.718
Tastes good.

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.466
Hi, babe. It's me again.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.884
This is driving me insane.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.304
Come on, babe. Just accept it.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.690
This one.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.778
Dongdaemun has plenty of hats like that.
That's enough. Let's head back.

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.572
Stop! Do Ra-mi.

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:04.781
This one's cute.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:05.782
Cute?

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:08.535
Hey!

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:12.998
Come on, seriously?

00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:16.710
Here. Let's see.

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.679
It's the hat she bought yesterday.

00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:36.396
Cheers.

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.613
It's delicious!

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:48.950
Stop drinking.
What do you think this is, lemon juice?

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.202
Auntie.

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:52.579
Mister, one more bottle, please.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:56.750
You've had enough. We're closing soon.

00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:58.460
Thank you.

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:00.128
They're closing. He wants us to go.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.724
- Babe…
- Quiet.

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.267
Hush.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.067
- I need the bathroom.
- Keep it down.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.282
Are you okay?

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.993
I'm okay.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.205
I had a few drinks last night.

00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:36.957
Should I have stopped her?

00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:40.877
These look good. I want one.

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:41.962
We need to go.

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.340
- That's enough--
- I love you!

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:49.594
Enough. It says they close
at 8:00 p.m. and open at 4:00 a.m.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:50.679
Oh yeah?

00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:53.014
I'll wait until 4:00 a.m., then.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.057
What?

00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:57.686
Excuse me?

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:02.649
What did you say?

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.565
They're opera lyrics from that movie.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.234
Thank you.

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:52.741
But, babe, I can't read this.
Write the Korean pronunciation too.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.920
We're going to an opera house.

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.797
Reciting opera lyrics from the movie
would make her seem smart

00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.466
and make everyone so happy.

00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:13.136
If you memorize these,
would Ms. Cha Mu-hee also know them?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.722
I told you. Our stats are the same.

00:25:16.223 --> 00:25:18.016
I'm stupid because she's stupid.

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.894
If I become smarter, so will she.

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:23.980
Stop.

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:30.195
I'm not sure if these lyrics will stick,
but I'm sure a hangover will.

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:31.821
Are you worrying about her?

00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:33.240
You're so kind.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:35.116
Sure.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.411
I'm doing my best to be kind,
since that's the only way you'll leave.

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:42.415
Then sing this to me
so I'll learn it faster.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:43.875
Is it too hard?

00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:47.003
Shall I help you memorize them?

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.257
Yeah. How are you going to help me?

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.885
For rote memorization,
repetition and testing work best.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.304
Try reciting them.

00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:02.310
Mamma, mamma mia, ma… Ma, ama--

00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:04.521
Wrong. Go again.

00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:06.731
Ama mimma?

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.858
- Again.
- Hey!

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:11.278
How can you test me if I barely read it?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.905
Is that right?
Then I'll give you a chance to review it.

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:16.950
One, two.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:28.128
Try it.

00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:39.097
You memorized them.

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.516
Repeat them until they stick.

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.565
That was quick.

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:53.445
Yeah, one thing Cha Mu-hee's good at
is memorizing her scripts.

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:56.448
You've got a good memory.
I'll give you that.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.992
You even memorize entry codes at a glance.

00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.997
Then reward me for passing the test.

00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:05.915
A reward?

00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:15.216
What? Are you feeling too shy
to do it here?

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.676
Should we go somewhere darker?

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:20.305
No, I like it nice and bright.

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:22.349
Scared, huh?

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:24.726
You're pretty cute when you're scared.

00:27:27.228 --> 00:27:28.063
Is that right?

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.192
Then can I ask you something
since I'm so cute?

00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:37.572
Ever since she arrived in Italy
and filming began,

00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:40.492
Ms. Cha Mu-hee has seemed
upbeat and settled.

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:42.619
So why are you still here?

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:52.587
To see you, babe.

00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.299
Don't joke around.

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:58.176
You're not so cute.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.056
Wanna know something
that's really not cute?

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:07.727
Cha Mu-hee remembers it all.
The accident from her childhood.

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:10.939
Accident?

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.402
My parents died in that accident,

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.488
but I don't remember a thing.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.784
The truth is, she saw everything
and remembers it all.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.954
She's lying,
pretending she doesn't know anything.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:30.041
That little kid plastered a smile
to her face to try to hide it,

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:32.711
but everyone hated her more for it.
Called her creepy.

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.928
Shall I tell you another secret?

00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:45.390
Before I went to your place that time…

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.893
I confronted her family.

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.020
You met her family?

00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:56.359
I dropped a few bombs in front of God.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:08.747
What, do you think I set off actual bombs?
I just used my words. I couldn't even…

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:11.624
I couldn't swear there.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.627
It was a church.
And I still want to go to heaven.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.885
Don't tell me to be grateful
they even took her in.

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:24.262
I've heard enough of that in here.

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.139
I'm proud of what I did.

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:48.453
What's this now?
Do you want me to repent or something?

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.663
The kindness you wanted.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:52.624
Just accept it.

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:54.542
Well done.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.133
Let's go.

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:31.204
I told you that kindness
makes me want to kill!

00:30:36.709 --> 00:30:38.962
Is this her becoming increasingly violent?

00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:44.676
"I felt like I might die
If someone was kind to me"

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.136
"For whatever I've done wrong"

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:51.599
"It felt as though kindness may kill me"

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.731
Kindness is scary.

00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.861
There is nothing more terrifying

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:06.531
than kindness that you believe
will come to an end.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.710
Amami, Alfredo.

00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:22.714
Quant'io t'amo.

00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:25.216
Quant'io t'amo.

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:27.218
Addio.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.016
What was that? Was it Italian?

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.142
Was it?

00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:36.644
Yeah, they're opera lyrics.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.481
Love me, Alfredo,

00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:43.776
as much as I love you.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:49.824
Good… bye?

00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:57.707
What does that mean?

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.292
They're opera lyrics.

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:01.586
"Love me, Alfredo,

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:04.923
as much as I love you."

00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:05.840
"Goodbye."

00:32:12.138 --> 00:32:15.058
Is the Italian I just said correct?

00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:17.518
Yes, it is.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.146
No way!

00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.736
You must really love that movie.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.783
Next time, let's go see
that opera you memorized.

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:33.534
From these seats.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.708
He's asking to see that opera
from the movie you love next time,

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.461
from the seats you're in now.

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:47.131
That sounds wonderful.
I look forward to it.

00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:08.987
What did I tell you?

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.824
She drops some opera lyrics
and immediately lands an opera date.

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:14.742
You don't even like operas.

00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:17.996
I bet you'd nod off
since you couldn't understand.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.664
Plus, it's pretty long.

00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:23.501
Have you seen that opera? With who?

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.298
I'm not asking for me.
I think Cha Mu-hee would want to know.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.383
Is that so?

00:33:30.883 --> 00:33:33.344
If Ms. Cha Mu-hee wants to know,
she'll ask me herself.

00:33:33.428 --> 00:33:36.264
How could she ask you?
She feels too bad to even talk to you.

00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:38.307
We spoke today just fine.

00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:41.185
That's just her talking to you
as the interpreter.

00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:43.104
You know that thing she's good at.

00:33:43.604 --> 00:33:45.815
Calling you "Mr. Joo Ho-jin,"

00:33:45.898 --> 00:33:48.484
then blurting whatever comes to mind.
She isn't doing that.

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.780
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.908
Who did you see the opera with?

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.202
What's that?

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:00.455
A film camera.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.874
I've heard it's pricey,
but I don't know how to use it.

00:34:02.957 --> 00:34:04.709
Did you buy it with Ms. Cha's card?

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:06.419
No, it's Hiro's.

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.089
Right. And why would you have that?

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.258
Well, I stole it.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.556
I just misheard, didn't I?

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.309
You didn't say you stole it, did you?

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.144
I did.

00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:27.440
Why exactly?

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.111
To make Hiro owe Cha Mu-hee big time.

00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:36.491
When he's feeling down,
thinking his prized possession is gone,

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.910
she'll whip it out with a "ta-da!,"
and he'll swoon.

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.454
They wouldn't just be going to the opera.

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:44.499
- Here. Hold onto it.
- Why are you giving me this?

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.417
You have to help her, babe.

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.337
Keep watch, and help her find it
at the perfect time.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.296
No, thanks.

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.800
Theft, concealment, and fraud?
I have no desire to help.

00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:01.140
Oh dear, what will we do, then?

00:35:01.724 --> 00:35:04.435
He'll think it's lost
and report it to the police.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:06.896
They would check the security footage,

00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.107
and I'd be on it.

00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:12.652
Cha Mu-hee would get arrested.

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:14.612
We can't have that, can we?

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:24.247
Since we're not filming tomorrow,
let's drink up tonight!

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.706
- Let's drink!
- Cheers.

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.212
Did you say that Hiro has plans tomorrow?

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:36.092
A photographer he's close with
invited him to her exhibition's opening.

00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:39.178
A party? I'm so jealous.

00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.973
Well, we're having a party of our own.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:43.975
Yong-u even booked us this trendy place.

00:35:44.058 --> 00:35:45.810
Ji-sun, you're not wearing your ring.

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:47.687
Right.

00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:50.273
Did you lose it? What will you do?

00:35:50.356 --> 00:35:51.983
No, I still have it.

00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:54.193
I took it off earlier to wash my hands.

00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:58.781
You scared me. You should be careful.

00:35:59.365 --> 00:36:01.576
I lost mine once and almost got divorced.

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.036
And where did you find it?

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:07.790
Come on, babe. You should be helping me.

00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:10.126
Put it back where it was
before you get caught.

00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:13.796
I don't want to.
Then she can't surprise him with "ta-da!"

00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:20.386
What is it?

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.475
What? Is it a "ta-da" situation?

00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:30.021
Stay still.

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.066
Right foot.

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.402
I said right foot.

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:38.821
- Now left foot.
- Left foot.

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:41.365
- This is delicious.
- It is.

00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:42.450
It's Tuscan beef.

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:44.911
You're absolutely right.

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:46.120
Pasta's good too.

00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:48.581
Isn't that Mr. Joo?

00:36:48.664 --> 00:36:50.625
- Mr. Joo?
- It is.

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.669
That's definitely the coat
he was wearing today.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:57.048
That was Ho-jin? Then who's that with him?

00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:59.717
Judging by their build, it's a woman.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.177
His girlfriend, then?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.596
- Was she pretty?
- Was she a foreigner?

00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:06.807
Things would've been awkward
if they'd seen us.

00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:23.658
Please don't do this.

00:37:24.158 --> 00:37:26.369
Ms. Do… Ra-mi.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.956
Not as awkward as getting locked up!

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:33.334
Come on, babe.

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.127
We need to protect Cha Mu-hee.

00:37:42.551 --> 00:37:43.928
What is she, a thug?

00:37:46.222 --> 00:37:47.974
We're going back to the opera house.

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:52.061
He says he lost something important,
so we're all going to go look for it.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.327
- What's this?
- The lens?

00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.162
- Come on.
- Seriously?

00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:12.456
- That's just the lens cap.
- That's not it.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.089
What's that there?

00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:21.632
That's not it.

00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.805
I think I'll go search up there.

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.140
Sure.

00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:54.540
What am I even doing?

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:05.509
Did she take one of me?

00:39:07.803 --> 00:39:10.306
No, the lens cap was on the whole time.

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:12.183
Or was it off?

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.938
She did keep fiddling with it.

00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:21.192
No. It was on.

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:22.943
Or was it off?

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:26.614
- No…
- Here it is!

00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:29.867
I found it!

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.869
- Really?
- You did?

00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:34.038
Thank goodness!

00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:35.748
I'll bring it down to the lobby.

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.957
- Okay.
- Come on down.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.167
Be careful!

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:45.466
I found it!

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.937
You were here?

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:00.856
Did you find it?

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.274
Let me take a look.

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:05.486
Right, this is…

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:07.279
Yeah, it all looks fine.

00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:08.280
And this.

00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:13.035
It all seems okay.
Thankfully, nothing looks broken.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.414
Right, broken…

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.874
It's not broken. That's good.

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:30.136
How could she ask you?
She feels too bad to even talk to you.

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:34.598
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:38.727
The opera.

00:40:41.313 --> 00:40:44.191
You may find Carmen more enjoyable
than La Traviata.

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:50.531
I dozed off while watching La Traviata,
but I enjoyed Carmen.

00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.159
You did?

00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:58.664
But that one isn't in Pretty Woman.

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:01.542
Of course.

00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:06.797
Then just see that one.
The person I saw it with enjoyed it.

00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:11.093
Anyway, I'm glad you found it.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.054
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:25.232
Who did you see it with?

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:29.695
It's just,

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:35.659
if the person you saw it with
is the same gender or a similar age to me,

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.913
maybe we'd have similar tastes,
and I'd enjoy it too.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.171
I saw it with an author for work.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.465
They wrote a book about operas.

00:41:50.132 --> 00:41:52.426
Their age…

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.095
He was a man in his fifties.

00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:58.390
What do you think?
Do you think your tastes would overlap?

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:00.893
Yes.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.773
I think they would.
My taste is pretty old-fashioned.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.401
That's good.

00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:12.279
You'll enjoy it, then.

00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:21.038
It's been ages since we talked.
Though I've heard your voice every day.

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:25.584
I've been keeping an eye on you
this whole time.

00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:33.175
Right.

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:36.303
You must have seen me on the monitors.

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.643
- How's the place you're--
- Mu-hee, where are you?

00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:06.000
Did you find it?

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:08.002
Did you really find it?

00:43:09.211 --> 00:43:10.421
Here.

00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:15.884
This is really precious to me.

00:43:17.803 --> 00:43:19.346
Thank you for finding it.

00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:21.265
Thank you.

00:43:21.348 --> 00:43:23.392
No need to thank me. It's all right.

00:43:23.475 --> 00:43:24.310
It's all right.

00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:25.894
We all found it together.

00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:28.731
She said, "It's okay.
We all found it together."

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.499
Who'd you see the opera with?

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.585
Who did you see it with?

00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:54.923
I ended up talking to her
thanks to Do Ra-mi.

00:43:57.676 --> 00:44:01.597
Did she steal that camera on purpose
to make us run into each other?

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:07.728
It just so happens
that La Traviata is playing here soon.

00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:12.775
I'd like to buy tickets,

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:16.403
but before I do,
I have something to ask you, Mr. Joo.

00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:21.825
Last night,

00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.995
I saw you with a woman.

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:30.417
I saw you, too, and tried to hide,
but I guess you caught me.

00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.213
Did you see who I was with?

00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:36.298
I didn't.

00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:41.261
Everyone else guessed
that she was your Italian girlfriend.

00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:45.057
But I saw her shoes.

00:44:47.726 --> 00:44:50.688
She was wearing the exact shoes
that Ms. Cha Mu-hee wore

00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:52.564
during yesterday's shoot.

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:58.821
Were you with Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.366
No.

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.619
That person wasn't Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:45:06.161 --> 00:45:07.162
It was someone else.

00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.503
In that case, I apologize.

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:40.654
This is the photographer
who took Hiro's debut photos.

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:45.075
The camera we were looking for today

00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.619
was a gift from her
to celebrate his debut,

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:50.205
an item that is very meaningful
and dear to him.

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:52.666
Thank you again.

00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:01.383
Yes. Nice to meet you.

00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:10.017
If it weren't for my exhibition,
I'd want to join too.

00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:12.394
But I guess I can't, since it's a shoot.

00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:18.066
Mu-hee won't be able to understand a word.

00:46:19.234 --> 00:46:22.154
So what if they can't communicate?
She can still see the photos.

00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:24.156
Let's enjoy ourselves too.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.242
- It's a party.
- There's wine that way.

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.295
Want some champagne?

00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:43.550
Sure.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.897
Yes. A winery.

00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.233
It's urgent.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.734
What's going on?

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:04.071
There's been a fire
at the location of our next shoot.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.074
The village festival has been canceled,

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.368
and the winery was damaged,
so we can't go there.

00:47:09.868 --> 00:47:11.328
Then what do we do now?

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.081
Well, we'll have to try
to find another winery,

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:16.041
or find an olive farm, or something.

00:47:16.124 --> 00:47:17.167
Or just a wine shop.

00:47:21.129 --> 00:47:23.674
He says there aren't any wineries
where we can shoot.

00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:26.844
Let me try calling a friend
who runs a travel agency.

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.387
Hold on.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.640
I think I read
in one of Na Jin-suk's essays

00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:35.602
that he knows someone
who runs a huge winery in Italy.

00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:38.897
Right. That winery.

00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:40.607
So he does?

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:43.777
Please put a call in to your fiancé.

00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:46.029
- Please?
- Ji-sun, please.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.292
Hello?

00:47:58.792 --> 00:48:00.711
Yeah, it's me.

00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:04.047
- Please.
- What's taking so long?

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:07.050
I'm not getting through to anyone.
This is driving me mad.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.180
We're good.
He got the okay from the owner.

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:15.893
He's our god! Our savior!

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:18.687
Ji-sun's fiancé saved us all.

00:48:19.354 --> 00:48:21.148
I thought I was going to pass out.

00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:23.859
- Goodness me.
- Give me one too.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.111
Drink this.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.530
You must have been anxious too.

00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:31.783
Right, thank you.

00:48:52.346 --> 00:48:54.514
You agreed to let
a Korean film crew shoot here?

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:56.558
I had no other choice.

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:59.311
It's such a rare opportunity
to see my son again.

00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:01.688
In any case,

00:49:02.397 --> 00:49:04.733
you must be excited to see him again.

00:49:05.317 --> 00:49:06.234
Yes.

00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:08.946
But honestly, I'm afraid.

00:49:09.029 --> 00:49:11.615
I've caused him so much pain.

00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:25.879
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:28.048
Are you here alone?

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.384
Won't your girlfriend
be joining you today?

00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:34.304
Did it seem like
that woman was my girlfriend?

00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:37.891
Well, yes. You two looked like a couple.

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.644
Was I mistaken?

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.522
Yes, you're mistaken.

00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:46.817
Won't she be coming anymore?

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:49.569
That's a shame.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:52.030
I thought I'd be getting
lucky number seven today.

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.575
I'm sorry?

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.002
She drew these every time she visited.

00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.588
These are

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:10.757
four-leaf clovers.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.927
That lady is an actress, is she not?

00:50:15.303 --> 00:50:19.474
I pretended not to recognize her
because I didn't want to be a bother.

00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:22.060
I didn't tell anyone about her either.

00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:23.895
Thank you very much.

00:50:24.563 --> 00:50:28.859
I thought I'd ask for her autograph
after collecting the seventh clover.

00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:29.818
It's too bad.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.657
She must really be hoping for something,

00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:37.784
to be collecting good luck like this.

00:50:39.786 --> 00:50:43.498
She believes that by collecting good luck,

00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:47.252
her wish will come true.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.886
I get so nervous speaking English.
I felt like I was dying.

00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.597
Where is Yong-u?

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.151
The Northern Lights.

00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:40.347
I wanted to see them too.

00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:40.949
I miss you.

00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.316
I could have sworn

00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:58.652
the zombie was crying.

00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:02.113
What's up with her?

00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:13.375
MS. CHA MU-HEE
BABE

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.510
I thought she'd be at the party.

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:24.928
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:54:52.497 --> 00:54:53.331
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:54:58.336 --> 00:54:59.254
You thought so?

00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:06.553
Shouldn't you be at the gallery?
Why'd you show up?

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.096
Because I missed you, babe.

00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:14.561
The party today was fantastic.
Stealing the camera worked.

00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:19.441
It's because I laid the groundwork
with that love confession song.

00:55:21.276 --> 00:55:22.360
All thanks to you.

00:55:22.944 --> 00:55:26.197
Unfortunately, that's not a love song.
It's a goodbye song.

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:29.576
What?

00:55:30.952 --> 00:55:31.995
That can't be right.

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.873
It plays at the end of Pretty Woman.

00:55:35.623 --> 00:55:37.292
That movie has a happy ending.

00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:41.004
It ended with them kissing,
so why a goodbye song? Is a kiss sad?

00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:41.921
Is a kiss tragic?

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:45.216
Maybe it means that, in reality,
there may not be a happy ending.

00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:48.803
In La Traviata, it's an aria
sung just before the lovers part.

00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:50.138
Then the woman dies.

00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:52.932
So,

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:56.561
the happy ending
she wholeheartedly believed in

00:55:57.103 --> 00:55:58.605
was just a delusion?

00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:04.110
In reality, she can never be happy.

00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:07.530
Thinking she'll never be happy
is also a delusion.

00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:10.200
You said she can never be happy,
didn't you?

00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:14.621
Delusions like these need to disappear

00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:17.374
for her to get
a happy ending in real life.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.713
To get a happy ending,

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:26.299
I should stop meeting you like this.

00:56:28.093 --> 00:56:30.178
Because this is her delusion too.

00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:35.266
Spending time with me
is Ms. Cha's delusion?

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:40.480
I told you I was doing the things
she wanted to but couldn't.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.818
I kept coming to see you…

00:56:46.986 --> 00:56:48.988
because she wanted to see you.

00:56:51.032 --> 00:56:52.117
She still

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:55.453
likes you a lot.

00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:01.292
You said you appeared

00:57:01.793 --> 00:57:04.170
because she feared people might discover

00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:06.506
the secret she wanted to hide.

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:08.508
That's right.

00:57:09.467 --> 00:57:12.512
And she's most afraid that you,
Joo Ho-jin, may find out her secret.

00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.643
So I was one of the reasons

00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:20.937
you appeared?

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:30.738
I'll also tell you something
that Cha Mu-hee could never tell you.

00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:34.409
She saw

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.581
exactly how her mom and dad died,
but she said she didn't.

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.625
Because…

00:57:50.925 --> 00:57:53.178
her mom killed her dad.

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.638
And tried to kill her too.

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:05.064
She lied, even to herself,
that she knew nothing.

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:06.816
Because she knew

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:11.946
that no one could ever love a child
who witnessed something so terrible.

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.286
That's why she became such a crazy bitch.

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.706
Always walking on eggshells,
afraid that people might hate her.

00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:24.751
Shamelessly waffling back and forth
on a whim and telling lies.

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:29.297
Clinging to someone, pleading to be loved,
then fleeing out of fear of rejection.

00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:32.258
She got one over on you too.

00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:35.345
She's the one who walked away out of fear,

00:58:35.428 --> 00:58:37.722
but she doesn't want you
to hate her either.

00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:39.265
The crazy bitch.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.135
Joo Ho-jin really is kind.

00:59:20.306 --> 00:59:22.684
With that kind heart of yours,

00:59:24.185 --> 00:59:25.687
leave this girl.

00:59:27.855 --> 00:59:29.399
So that I can disappear.

00:59:34.279 --> 00:59:36.114
Once you leave her

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.701
and this painful delusion vanishes…

00:59:43.288 --> 00:59:44.789
she'll be happy.

00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:48.376
That'll be our happy ending.

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:07.103
Love me, Mr. Joo Ho-jin…

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:12.191
as much as I love you.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:17.822
Goodbye.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.436
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:13.706
