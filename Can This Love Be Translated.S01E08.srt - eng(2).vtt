00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.972
Lord, through your Son,

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.225
pour in abundance the power
of the Holy Spirit upon this water

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:23.732
so that all who have died with Christ
may rise with him to new life.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:28.611
Your Son lives and reigns with you
forever and ever.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.780
Amen.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.200
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:41.458
Now God will share his own life
with this child.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.004
I invite you to participate
in this sacred celebration with joy.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.159
Are the godparents,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.287
who will help guide the child in faith,

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.456
present here today?

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.167
I'm here!

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:37.806
The child's godmother is here,
at your service.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.396
Who is that?

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.233
Auntie, Uncle, sorry I'm a tad late.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.735
Long time no see, cuz! Hey, sis!

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.120
Is this woman
really this child's godmother?

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.052
Yes, she is.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.639
She's part of our family
and will be the godmother.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.396
Godmother, please take the child
into your arms

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.314
so we may proceed with the ceremony.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.815
In the name of the Father,

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.276
and of the Son,

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.778
and of the Holy Spirit,

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.573
I baptize Angela.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.490
Amen.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.534
Amen. (Support Admin Watch on

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.668
Mu-hee, have you truly lost your mind?

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.962
How dare you show up here!

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.340
You called her family
in front of the priest.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.218
You even said in that article
that she's family.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.804
So are you here to exercise your right
as a member of this family?

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.766
You showed up with flowers
to your niece's baptism?

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.560
Not at all.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:53.024
I'm not part of your family.
We have no connection whatsoever.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.151
Because I'm not Cha Mu-hee.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.196
What?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.657
I'm Do Ra-mi.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.661
Do Ra-mi? Are you here to film
a sequel or something?

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.413
Guess you didn't see the movie, lady.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.917
If I were here to shoot a movie,
I wouldn't have brought flowers.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.503
In the movie,
Do Ra-mi brings something else.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.256
Like what?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.386
Dead people.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.521
She brings back the dead
whom her foes would fear most.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.110
I wonder…

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.613
which dead people

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.825
the two of you…

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.328
would fear the most.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.382
Mu-hee, by any chance,

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.385
do you remember how your parents died?

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.346
Should I say no like I did back then?

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.061
Fine.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:16.316
I'll act clueless and smile for you.
Like I did then, disgustingly.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.987
Is that so?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.533
Well, some things are best
left in the dark.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.369
For our sake

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.704
and yours.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.917
If you want to keep things that way,
stay away from her.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:40.340
If you show up unannounced again
and shake her up however you please,

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.633
she just might explode.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.303
Boom!

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.433
- Why you--
- Now…

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.144
This girl

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.440
is no longer a piece of trash
you can keep hidden away.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.276
She's a bomb that could kill us all.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.325
May you receive abundant grace from God

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.203
and go to heaven.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:12.747
Amen.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:36.229
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.981
Hi, I'm Do Ra-mi.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.902
Do Ra-mi?

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:48.074
Do Ra-mi, huh? I didn't expect to meet
that famous person like this.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.867
Oh, not her.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.370
That zombie is way too scary.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:55.331
Not her, but the Do Ra-mi only you know.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.711
The crazy bitch… in Cha Mu-hee's head.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.716
The one who's too dangerous
to meet alone at night?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.803
So you remembered.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.598
You're the one I've heard so much about.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.351
But judging by your outfit,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.353
you don't look all that scary.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.021
Though hardly ordinary.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.566
What do you think? Pretty cute, right?

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:24.902
I had a photo shoot.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:26.946
A photo shoot…

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.993
I heard you made it to your shoot
just fine this morning.

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:34.662
How… did you even get in here?

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:35.746
I used the passcode.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.375
I peeked when I came in
behind that novelist.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.465
For a crazy person, you're meticulous.
Remembering the passcode and all.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.676
That's how Cha Mu-hee is. She's sneaky.

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:51.929
Creepy, isn't she?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.933
Yes. I feel quite uncomfortable,
thanks to you.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.396
You can speak casually.
I even know your passcode.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.108
I don't normally drop honorifics
and speak harshly to people I've just met,

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.069
but if you say so, I will.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:09.489
That's enough.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.784
Whatever vibe you came prepared with,

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.121
I won't humor you anymore.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.832
So quit it and leave.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.418
This isn't funny. Please get lost.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.941
I don't want to take a taxi.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.404
Can't you just drive me yourself?

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:53.908
Joo Ho-jin.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.497
Hey, Ho-jin.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.794
Babe?

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:12.218
Babe, are you mad
because I stood you up yesterday?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.429
You were forgiving
even after being dumped in Canada.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.265
Why are you being all pouty now?

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.975
You cutie.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:25.106
Fine. Once the taxi gets here,
let's head over to my place.

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:29.235
I have a great bottle of wine.
Shall we crack it open and set the mood?

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.155
We could listen to that song.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.791
The more I listen to it,
the more I like that gentleman's song.

00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:50.923
The taxi is almost here.
Once it arrives, get in and go home.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.342
Why send me off? I'll just come back.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.181
Yes, sir.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.559
We're waiting outside. Yes.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.060
Yes.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.147
Yes, I see you. Right here.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:07.982
All right.

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:11.777
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:13.487
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:15.239
Ms. Cha--

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.534
Please hold on a moment.
I'm not the passenger.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.452
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.954
It's not for me. She's in--
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.351
Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:46.771
The taxi is waiting.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:49.065
Seriously, quit it and go home.

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:01.243
If you don't come out,
I'm calling the police for trespassing.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:03.287
Babe?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.001
Did I scare you?

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.797
Joo Ho-jin, you sleep in this?
This is your kind of thing?

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:14.715
Pretty kinky.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:15.966
That's my brother's.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.011
That's meant for the wash.
Why are you wearing it?

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:21.972
Hand that over now. Give it…

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.558
I like it. I'm wearing it to bed tonight.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.604
Why? Why would you wear that to bed,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.106
Should I sleep naked, then?

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.316
Come on, that'd be too naughty!

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.445
Your taxi's waiting.

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:40.282
Get up and go already.
If you like it, it's yours. Take it.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.035
I've had such a busy day. I'm exhausted.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.453
Where do you think…

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:47.707
- Don't even think about falling asleep.
- Right.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.750
I should shower before bed.
Should I shower first?

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.710
You can't.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:53.129
- Fine. You wash first.
- Ms. Cha Mu-hee!

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.965
I told you. I'm not her.

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:03.431
Hey.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.934
How could she show her face here
after what she did?

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.236
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.029
Please wait a moment.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.407
She'll be right out.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.579
Okay, fine.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.416
Then let's talk, Ms. Do Ra-mi.

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.587
Did she send you, Ms. Do Ra-mi,
to clean up her mess

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:37.506
because she couldn't begin to apologize
for yesterday?

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.634
I'm not here to apologize.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:49.059
I'm here to tell you
never to accept her apology,

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:50.978
no matter what.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:52.980
For your sake.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:56.400
You're going to Italy together.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.695
I'm giving you advice
so you won't be swayed.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.781
Thanks for the advice,
but I don't need it.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.657
I won't be going to Italy.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.994
I'm looking for an interpreter
to replace me.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.455
I'm walking away to stay out of it.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.751
I am angry about yesterday,

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.170
but I get that something may have come up.

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.839
And as absurd as this situation is,

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.966
I can brush it off as you being playful.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.927
However, I

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:27.264
dislike people who disregard and neglect
others' feelings

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.724
based on their own mood.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.519
No. To be accurate,
I hate people like that.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:35.189
Dumping your emotions on someone
and hoping they'll deal with it

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.900
is, in itself,
a form of threat and torture.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.987
The way I see it, your actions toward me

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:45.825
are like those of a child
throwing a tantrum over a toy.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.204
I have no desire to play along,
so I'll just have to avoid you.

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:53.207
You said you gather your thoughts
before speaking.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.627
So what you're saying

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.505
is that you hate Cha Mu-hee.

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:00.589
That's right.

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:03.884
I don't want you near me anymore.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.096
I'm going to do my best to avoid you.

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.390
I don't intend to change my mind.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:13.894
I'm done thinking.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.943
So it's definitely over.
Don't change your mind.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.446
It's over.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.574
What's over now?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.160
The timer.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.246
I medicated you, just in case.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.252
Things could get complicated
if you and Cha Mu-hee were to meet here.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.255
Still claiming you're Do Ra-mi?

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:46.010
Yes. So if you run into Cha Mu-hee,
don't bring up what happened today.

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:48.304
So you're really set on…

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.017
Sleep tight.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:56.437
And keep today's promise.

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:13.120
Going back to the toy.

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.957
How do you think a child
who's never had one would feel?

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.920
Maybe it's her first time
wanting anything,

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.589
and she just doesn't know how to act.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.635
Does that still count as a tantrum?

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.932
This is why I emerged.
Because she's so pathetic.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.223
Are you awake?

00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:20.521
Today's the day I agreed to move in.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:22.231
Right.

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.317
I couldn't reach you, so I entered
using the passcode you gave me.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.069
I was surprised you were home.

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:30.114
Why did you sleep out here?
Were you drinking?

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:31.991
Drinking…

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.500
I moved my stuff inside for now.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.085
There's not much.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.736
ZOLPIDEM, TRAZODONE, RAMELTEON
TAKE AT BEDTIME

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.238
I medicated you, just in case.

00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:13.991
She actually drugged me?

00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:19.955
These are sleeping pills.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:23.292
Why did she put me to sleep?

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:29.798
Things could get complicated
if you and Cha Mu-hee were to meet here.

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.553
How could things get complicated
when she came to see me?

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:38.098
Although she really did act
like a different person.

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.267
Mr. Joo.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.519
I'll put my stuff in my room.

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:43.479
Yeah, sure.

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:45.147
By the way…

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.443
does Ms. Cha Mu-hee

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:53.614
ever call herself Do Ra-mi
and joke around with you too?

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:56.366
All the time.
"Watch yourself. I'm Do Ra-mi."

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.659
That sort of thing.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.952
Is that right?

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.872
Plus, everybody loves it
when she acts like Do Ra-mi.

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:05.209
She was a hit at yesterday's shoot.
Everyone said Do Ra-mi's the best.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:07.169
Mu-hee was in a great mood too.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.088
Right, the outfit!

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.174
That was close.

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.343
Why? Did something happen?

00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:17.596
Mu-hee just left
wearing her photo shoot outfit.

00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:21.100
So people don't normally leave the set

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.519
wearing their photo shoot outfits?

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.436
Of course not.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.940
She said she was so tired
that she went straight home and crashed.

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:30.067
That's what she said? Did you see for…

00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:32.069
Is she okay now?

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.988
I spoke to her earlier,
and she's doing Pilates now.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:36.782
Pilates?

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:44.081
Mu-hee, you're really giving it
your all today.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.084
I have a lot on my mind.

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:49.461
I just want to focus on the workout.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.597
About the replacement interpreter
you wanted me to find.

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.142
I have a Japanese friend named Yoko,

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.686
but she's not fluent in Italian.

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:07.104
She's available though.

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.856
That's great. Thanks.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:09.773
No problem.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.945
I know you.

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:18.740
You're not the irresponsible type
to quit a job halfway through. So why?

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.119
Is it perhaps because of Do Ra-mi?

00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:24.413
Her name is Cha Mu-hee.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.957
Don't call her Do Ra-mi. It's confusing.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.542
Speaking of Cha Mu-hee,

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:31.086
I thought Do Ra-mi turned her life around,

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.380
but I guess she was born rich.

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.592
If her family runs
an educational foundation,

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.219
perhaps they have ties
with your grandfather.

00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:41.930
Why bring up my dead grandfather?

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.641
Education and publishing
are inseparable, are they not?

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.853
Stop making something out of nothing.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:51.732
Anyway, that Cha Mu-hee…
I guess she was born with a silver spoon.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.151
I'm so jealous.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:59.531
How do you think a child
who's never had one would feel?

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:02.117
Whether she lives or dies,
please don't contact us.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.454
But seriously,

00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:07.122
why are you quitting?

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:09.208
Did she dump you?

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:12.336
Yeah, if I got stood up and dumped,

00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:14.713
got upset, got wasted, passed out,

00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:18.008
and quit my job in the heat of the moment,

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:22.429
wouldn't that be a very normal way
of ending things?

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:26.266
Okay, then what's not normal?

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.728
Drugging the person
who wants to call it quits,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.356
then going to a Pilates class,
all refreshed.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.066
What?

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.360
Who is this psychopath?

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.071
Is she Do Ra-mi?

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.825
Hi, I'm Do Ra-mi.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.084
Please contact Yoko as soon as possible.

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:55.170
Tell her I'd like her to make the decision
as soon as possible.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.423
We won't have cameras on her
when she's flying out to Italy,

00:20:58.507 --> 00:20:59.800
so you can travel in peace.

00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:00.926
Great.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:02.761
As for accommodations,

00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:05.722
we booked an entire villa in Italy,
just like we did in Canada.

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.350
This time,
Hiro will also be staying with us.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:13.647
All these articles about Mu-hee's family
have got me thinking.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.068
What would you say to her and Hiro
discussing their families while in Italy?

00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:21.571
If possible, they could do video calls
with their families and stuff.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.240
I'm so sorry,

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:27.869
but she's not exactly close with them,
so I don't think they'd agree to be on TV.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.162
Is that right?

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.998
Then it can't be helped.

00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:33.041
As for Hiro, I asked his team,

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.127
and they say
he's a total fool for his niece.

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.254
He's prickly,

00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:40.424
but apparently, he dotes on his niece.

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:41.758
Really?

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:45.012
Then we should prepare a gift
for his niece before our meeting today.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.807
You're meeting Hiro?

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:50.976
Today?

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.894
He's in Seoul. Didn't you know?

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.647
We didn't.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.069
- Would you like to join us?
- No!

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.113
He came for personal reasons!

00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:05.157
We shouldn't bother him. That wouldn't do.

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:09.786
Hiro's niece is five years old.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.081
The little girl's favorite character
is Power Thunder Blue.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.708
Her favorite color is also blue.

00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:18.378
If you get her something pink
because she's a girl, she won't like that.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:21.089
Got it? No pink, but blue.

00:22:21.798 --> 00:22:23.300
Just for your reference.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.844
Blue? Sure.

00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:28.513
Mu-hee's dropping by
for her interview, isn't she?

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.265
Yes, she'll be here soon.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:35.354
Where's Producer Shin?

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:37.105
She hasn't come to work yet.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:40.108
I heard she was editing all night
and only got home this morning.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.276
Right.

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:46.823
PRODUCER SHIN JI-SUN

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:48.825
Come out. We need to talk.

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.372
Where are you?

00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:56.750
I'm downstairs.

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.714
Come up. I'll be waiting.

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:24.277
Yeah, I should end things
before I run into him at work.

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:16.830
Okay.

00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:19.666
Let's not run away from what I did.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.175
Be right there.

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.264
You're not the delivery person.

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.225
May I help you?

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.355
I was told to come up…

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.986
Honey, were you expecting someone?
Come out here.

00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.408
How may I help you?

00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:58.205
It's nothing. Thanks.

00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:03.084
Wow, what a douchebag.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.754
Did he tell me to come up
just so I could see her?

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:08.548
I had no intention of being clingy anyway.

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:17.724
The phone you're calling is turned off.
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:19.476
After the beep, charges may apply…

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.686
She's not answering her phone.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.438
Why isn't she coming up?

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.325
Come on. Can we please discuss this?

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:38.245
I don't know that woman.
I only heard her voice.

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.330
- You really don't know her?
- I really don't!

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:42.916
- Look into my eyes, honey.
- Let go of me.

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:47.337
Come on, why are we arguing for no reason
on our moving day?

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.882
I mean, we've been dating for 3,000 days!
Hey, wait. I bought that!

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:54.052
Yu-jeong!

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:56.972
I'm going to talk
to the production staff now.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:59.057
I'll call you back right away. Bye.

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.820
Mu-hee! Did you bring the outfit?

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:15.490
- Sorry. I was so out of it yesterday.
- I can just return it today.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:16.908
Sorry for the trouble.

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:18.076
It's okay.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.370
There's something here.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.333
- What is this?
- You don't know?

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.919
I don't. What is this?

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.922
"Kindness, to me"?

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.174
Looks like a page torn out of a book.

00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:47.147
Hello, Mr. Joo.

00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:50.859
This is a poem.

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:55.739
Don't you know this poem?

00:26:57.198 --> 00:26:58.199
I don't.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.452
I've never heard it before.

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:06.541
You haven't?

00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:08.376
I haven't.

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:11.129
I don't know much about poetry.

00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:13.673
But what is this doing in here?

00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:17.344
Maybe whoever wore this last
returned it without washing it.

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.679
Just throw it out. Mu-hee, let's head up.

00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:20.597
Okay.

00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.148
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:34.527
I've been meaning to say this.

00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:39.282
I'm sorry.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.286
I'm truly sorry about everything.

00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:55.840
I'm here to tell you
not to accept her apology,

00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:57.175
no matter what.

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:20.865
Yong-u.

00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:21.908
Yes?

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.577
Ms. Cho told me

00:28:25.995 --> 00:28:29.541
that we'll get to see a real festival
when we go to Italy.

00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:30.625
That's nice.

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:34.546
We'll even get to see vineyards
and old castles.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.257
If I don't go,

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.509
I won't get to see all that.

00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:44.013
And I'd probably never
get to see him again.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.324
Hey, Yong-u.

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:05.535
Let's say

00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:09.831
things got so hard
that you wanted to quit everything.

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:11.666
Imagine blinking your eyes

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:14.753
to find someone's done all your work.
How might that feel?

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:17.213
They'd get a big "thank you" from me.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:18.548
Right?

00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:22.385
Surely it's normal
that I'm somewhat grateful.

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:23.678
Do you mean Do Ra-mi?

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.931
What?

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:31.227
Like you said, in the blink of an eye,
Do Ra-mi made you a fairy tale superstar.

00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:36.232
That's true.

00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:39.194
If you think about it, it's almost unreal.

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:43.364
While you were lying in bed,
Do Ra-mi did something incredible.

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.075
You're right.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.453
And I didn't do a thing.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.747
I don't remember any of it either.

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:53.750
When you don't want to do something,

00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:56.586
imagine you could just close your eyes
and say,

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:59.839
"Do Ra-mi, do my homework,"
or "Clean the bathroom," and it's done.

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:01.257
If only that were real.

00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.015
But it is real.

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:30.286
I can't do a thing.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.332
Should I just give it all up?

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.533
In the blink of an eye,
she had done everything.

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.661
Is it just like what happened back then?

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.248
Is it okay to go on like this?

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:10.386
They can't communicate at all,
so how will they talk without you there?

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.263
They should be able to.

00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:17.393
It was only for a short time,

00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:20.813
but Hiro has been studying hard
to be able to talk to her directly.

00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:27.654
This

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:30.198
is a present for your niece.

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.866
How do I say it?

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.583
Thanks for the present. She'll love it.

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:42.877
You can speak Korean?

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.046
I studied a little.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.881
Wow, that's amazing.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.928
Now I feel bad.
I can't speak any Japanese.

00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:53.304
I should've studied too.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.057
Slowly. My listening's not great.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.103
Okay, I'll speak slowly.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.399
Did she get drunk and offend him somehow?

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:06.192
I'm wondering the same thing.

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:11.030
He said he'd ask Ms. Cha Mu-hee about it.

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:17.370
What is it

00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:19.789
that you said to me?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.044
I really… don't remember.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:26.879
I'm sorry.

00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:30.883
That day, you were looking me
straight in the eye.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:36.389
What's he saying?
I guess he really did study only a little.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:41.144
I need to know what you said to me
before I can ask why you did what you did.

00:33:42.895 --> 00:33:45.523
I have no idea what you're saying.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:49.402
You,

00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:50.862
to me.

00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:54.115
Kiss!

00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.245
Kiss!

00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:02.248
Kiss?

00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:04.792
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:09.547
Come on. You're lying.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.133
A lie, gura.
I know that word at least, gura.

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.301
A lie?

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.554
You're the one who's lying!
There's no way you don't remember!

00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:20.475
If you said I was drunk and puked on you,
I'd believe it, even if I didn't remember.

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:24.520
But there's no way I'd do… that to you.

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:27.231
I don't understand you,
but I can tell you're denying it.

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.318
This is so frustrating.
Let's call Nanami over.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.903
No. There's no need.

00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:34.697
I think that tells me everything
I wanted to know.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.704
I studied Korean,

00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:44.874
thinking it might help me remember
what you said that day.

00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:47.627
It didn't, so I came here to ask you.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.882
But I guess
what I really wanted to confirm

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.636
wasn't what you said that day…

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.518
but your feelings.

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:09.148
Whether you remember it or not,

00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:14.612
it's clear you didn't do it
because you like me.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:22.787
Maybe our language barrier isn't so bad.

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.916
If you understood me,
I could never be so honest with you.

00:35:39.428 --> 00:35:40.388
Eat your food.

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:44.517
You're paying!

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.704
Did Do Ra-mi do all that?

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:06.831
But why?

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.757
Do I really need to quit everything?

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:33.649
If I quit everything, what will you do?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:40.740
If I blink my eyes right here, right now,

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.784
what would you do?

00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:55.796
KINDNESS, TO ME

00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:01.594
You're doing great.

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:06.432
You're the only one who knows
about the hater inside my head.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.811
So keep rooting… for Cha Mu-hee
just like you are now.

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:13.105
For her not to let Do Ra-mi win.

00:37:26.452 --> 00:37:28.704
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, where are you? Let's meet.

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:32.250
You probably already know,
but I need to check something.

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:34.252
It's important, so let's talk in person.

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.838
Hey, you promised
you wouldn't tell Cha Mu-hee.

00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:50.017
Babe, why are you doing this?
You said you wouldn't change your mind.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:53.229
Ms.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.314
Do Ra-mi?

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:57.692
I'm busy right now. Bye.

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.361
Ms. Do Ra-mi. Ms. Do--

00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:04.615
She's driving me nuts.

00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:08.369
Thanks for the food.

00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:12.581
If you ever come to Japan,
it'll be my treat.

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:16.335
But I guess you wouldn't have
understood that.

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.248
How was your talk?

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.375
You two can't even communicate.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.129
You have Cha Mu-hee's passport, don't you?

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.674
Yes, since we're flying to Italy
in two days.

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.009
Hand it over.

00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:18.189
I'll go on ahead to Italy first.

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.358
Sure. What?

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:23.069
Join me there later.

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.029
Mu-hee?

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.536
ITALY

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:13.953
PAPAGO

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.540
For crying out loud.

00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:19.250
I told him not to call.

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:27.425
Babe, what is it?
Why are you calling again?

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:28.884
Where are you?

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.679
You asked to meet. Where are you now?

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.848
Will you come here if I tell you?

00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:36.517
I intend to, but I can't find you.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.395
If you raise your hand,
I might just be able to see you.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.064
Come find me.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.941
I need to confirm something.

00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:48.362
Are you Ms. Cha Mu-hee's hater?

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:52.199
Yeah, sure. That's me.

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:54.785
But it was all constructive, for her sake.

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.079
And for your good, too, you know.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.874
She'd only be trouble.
It was smart to avoid her.

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:03.252
From the bottom of my heart,
I really wanted to avoid her too.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.259
I hoped never to greet you formally.

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.053
I'm not at all glad to see you,

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.014
Ms. Do Ra-mi.

00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.606
Mu-hee's already in Italy?

00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:27.485
Lucky her.
Filming is different from traveling.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.112
When was my last solo trip, anyway?

00:41:30.613 --> 00:41:32.490
How was her meeting with Hiro?

00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:36.243
Well, I think the two of them had a tiff.

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.330
Hiro didn't look too happy
as he left the restaurant.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:46.962
I'm here.
Did you get a lot of editing done?

00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:49.173
- Yeah.
- Yong-u brought us snacks again.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:51.842
They're your favorite, macarons. Eat up.

00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:53.928
Thanks a lot for these.

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:02.228
Hey, did you try finding the footage
I mentioned?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.816
- There's a slight copyright issue.
- How should we get around that?

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.361
- Find other footage?
- The cream's delicious.

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:12.321
I'll head out, then.

00:42:12.404 --> 00:42:13.948
- Wait, you're leaving?
- Yes.

00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:15.866
Yong-u is leaving.

00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:18.202
Thanks for these.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.747
Bye, and thanks again.

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.397
So you ignore calls when you're mad?

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:48.774
Yeah.

00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:51.026
I don't really like fighting.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.405
I fight if I have to.

00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:56.907
Even if I get roughed up a bit.

00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:01.870
Go ahead and hit me. I can take it.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.252
I'm not mad at you, Yong-u.

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:09.753
I'm mad at myself.

00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:12.715
I got mad and picked a fight
with the wrong person.

00:43:14.466 --> 00:43:16.969
Please just think of it
as brushing shoulders

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:20.180
with an angry passerby and move on.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:24.351
Let's just… put an end to this
with me apologizing.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.896
So you're dumping me?

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:32.318
"Dumping"? We never dated
in the first place.

00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:35.946
It was literally a one-night stand.
A single night's affair.

00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:39.158
I'm not like that.

00:43:41.243 --> 00:43:44.747
I'm not the type to casually sleep
with someone and then walk away.

00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:47.666
I didn't take you for that type either.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.545
As far as I know,
we started dating that night.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:53.505
If it's over, you're dumping me.

00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.177
Wow.

00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:02.681
I was willing to call it bumping shoulders
and let it go,

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.475
but you're really picking a fight.

00:44:06.602 --> 00:44:09.355
Hey. Then let's get the facts straight.

00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:11.649
You don't do one-nighters,
but you'll two-time?

00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:14.068
Two-time?

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.237
You told me to come up
so I would see that woman at your house.

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:20.240
If you're dating that woman and me,
that makes you a two-timer.

00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:23.035
Do I look that easy to you?

00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:25.871
Is that why you want to date me,
even though you have a girlfriend?

00:44:25.954 --> 00:44:27.873
- Forget it.
- You were at my house that day?

00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:30.000
I told you to come down,
but you said to come up.

00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:30.959
I moved.

00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:33.045
I don't live there.

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:42.971
So that's why you ignored my calls
after saying you'd come up.

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.058
I was waiting here.

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.103
I knew you'd be editing late,
so I brought you coffee.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.911
Can I drink that?

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:22.302
I was freaking out.
I thought you were dumping me.

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.850
So you're not dumping me, then?

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:38.902
I'm speechless.
I feel like… I just got gut-punched.

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:41.363
Let me drink some too.
Maybe it'll snap me out of it.

00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:10.976
Three-thousand-dollar wine,
a shopping spree, and a hotel suite.

00:46:11.477 --> 00:46:12.895
You're reckless with her money.

00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:14.897
She earned it thanks to me.

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.820
That's French,
and it means something else.

00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:23.113
She is the stupid one.

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:27.451
In any case, it's good to know
that your stats match Ms. Cha Mu-hee's.

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:31.246
As Do Ra-mi, I thought you'd be
more impressive, like the character.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.081
I may not know bonjour,

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:36.418
but this and this are all I need here.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.299
What, are you here to defeat Do Ra-mi
like some kind of superhero?

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:46.678
Too bad. I'm doing so great.

00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:49.306
You came in vain.

00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:52.851
I did hesitate before coming here.

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.813
Even with the hallucinations,
she was fine,

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.732
and she didn't even ask
for my help this time.

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:03.195
And I especially didn't like the thought
of hearing you… call me "babe."

00:47:05.113 --> 00:47:07.449
Why are you being like this, babe?

00:47:11.703 --> 00:47:12.913
And that made me curious.

00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:16.208
Why did a being like you emerge from her?

00:47:19.294 --> 00:47:23.298
Because… I'm the one
who made Cha Mu-hee's festival possible?

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.301
That's what I thought too.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:30.138
That after the accident
and the sudden change in her environment,

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:33.517
she'd started seeing these hallucinations.

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:37.479
- But I don't think that's it.
- Then what do you think it is?

00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:42.276
Contrary to the recent articles,

00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:44.444
she wasn't happy and privileged.

00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:47.698
What would you know?

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.703
There's one other thing
I learned unwillingly.

00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:57.541
I saw a woman lying alone
in an eight-bed hospital room

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.836
while her family said
they didn't care whether

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:02.629
she lived or died.

00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:10.178
You said she was a child
who never had anything she wanted,

00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:11.972
didn't you?

00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:18.562
Perhaps you didn't emerge
due to a rapid change in her environment,

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.273
but from a much deeper

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:25.110
and darker past.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.868
No wonder you were so kind.

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:35.787
You saw that pitiful scene.

00:48:37.664 --> 00:48:40.834
If I'm right,
now tell me your side of the story.

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.002
You're right.

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.546
I emerged because she's so pitiful.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.342
Then, if she becomes happy,
you won't show up? You'll disappear?

00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.385
You clearly have no idea.

00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:53.639
I'm telling you,
this girl can never be happy.

00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:54.556
Why not?

00:48:59.728 --> 00:49:00.687
Treat me more kindly.

00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:03.690
What?

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.525
If you're kind to me,

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.443
I'll tell you.

00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:09.112
- You told me not to be kind.
- Look.

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.075
What if the desire to die
when someone shows kindness

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.578
goes up against the desire to kill
in the face of kindness?

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.789
What should kindness do?

00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:24.002
I told you not to get involved
and to walk away, yet here you are.

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.338
So own it and continue to be kind.

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:33.220
Your timing was perfect, actually.
I was worried about maxing out my card.

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:35.722
It's on you.

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:38.350
Thanks, babe. Bonjour.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.436
Sit down, Do Ra-mi. Wait, Do Ra-mi!

00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:49.444
Thank you.

00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:57.995
Here. Hey, take these bags.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.414
Damn, my phone is dying.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.749
Do you have a charger?

00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:05.585
- You don't?
- No.

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.129
- You don't?
- No!

00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:09.297
Shoot. Where should I charge my phone?

00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:14.845
Come. I'll ask someone
to charge it for you.

00:50:15.887 --> 00:50:16.805
Follow me.

00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:18.015
How sweet of you.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.184
Babe, wait up!

00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:25.147
You know what?
We're already speaking casually.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:26.523
Like we're close!

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.791
Could we possibly get a refund?

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:46.251
That woman

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:50.589
made some impulsive purchases.

00:50:50.672 --> 00:50:54.634
Sure. To proceed with the refund,
I'll need the card she paid with.

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:55.802
Yes, sure.

00:50:56.762 --> 00:50:58.638
Do Ra-mi, your card.

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:01.099
What?

00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:03.018
I need to pay to charge my phone?

00:51:03.101 --> 00:51:04.936
How stingy.

00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:08.732
Even bathrooms cost money here.

00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:11.151
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:12.194
Thank you so much.

00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:20.702
Thank you.

00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:22.662
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:25.874
Why's she taking those? Gimme those!

00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:28.043
Don't. I just got a refund.

00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:31.296
Dummy, I'll just buy them again.

00:51:31.379 --> 00:51:33.173
You can't. The refund takes three days.

00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:35.801
Your card is still maxed out.

00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:39.346
How's your phone looking?

00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:44.768
Looks like it'll die soon.
What'll you do now?

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.938
Your trusty credit card and phone
are both useless now.

00:52:19.427 --> 00:52:24.224
Looks like the Korean production crew
will get in after midnight.

00:52:24.724 --> 00:52:27.352
Will you eat something
before heading to the hotel?

00:52:28.186 --> 00:52:35.193
CHA MU-HEE
I'LL BE WAITING

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.296
You said you'd make her happy.
And you brought pizza?

00:52:57.048 --> 00:52:58.675
You wanted a view of that place.

00:52:58.758 --> 00:53:02.220
There were no decent restaurants nearby,
but you said you were hungry.

00:53:02.304 --> 00:53:05.182
Then what about there? And there?

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:09.644
I may not speak Italian, but I have eyes.
They're restaurants.

00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:11.229
Those places are expensive.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:13.982
That wine you made me pay for earlier.

00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:17.360
Do you know how much it cost?

00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.113
You're doing good. Just eat your pizza.

00:53:21.072 --> 00:53:22.657
You could've at least bought drinks.

00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:29.206
Finish what you were saying earlier.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.500
Will you really disappear
once she's happy?

00:53:33.668 --> 00:53:35.921
Probably. But that won't be easy.

00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.924
That's why you keep leaving hate comments?
So she can't ever be happy?

00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:43.094
She kept hesitating,
so I cracked the whip a little.

00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:44.804
Even coming to Italy.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:48.058
She was debating whether to come,
so I just went ahead and did it.

00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:51.144
So, to summarize,

00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:55.398
you're doing the things she thinks about
but can't bring herself to do.

00:53:55.482 --> 00:53:56.358
That's right.

00:53:57.609 --> 00:54:00.570
If she finds out I met you,
she probably won't be able to bear it.

00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:03.573
It would mean you know her inner thoughts.

00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:10.247
Too bad for you, babe.

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.124
You said you were done,
but you're back in it.

00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:14.542
Nothing has changed.

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:18.713
What I said that day wasn't directed
at you but at Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:21.383
I'm not here to take those words back.

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:32.269
Despite all that,
I'm the reason you're here, aren't I?

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:35.855
You want me to disappear?

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:43.655
All right, then I'll tell you a way
to make that happen.

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:46.157
A way?

00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:53.290
If I drink some hot coffee,

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:56.459
it might make her so happy
that I'd disappear.

00:54:58.586 --> 00:55:00.797
And if you were to put two sugars
in that coffee,

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.633
I might melt away into thin air.

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.343
And

00:55:07.053 --> 00:55:09.139
in a short while, when that bell rings,

00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:12.309
she'll become truly happy.

00:55:15.186 --> 00:55:16.104
Trust me.

00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:20.984
I have no choice but to.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:23.611
All I can do right now
is listen to what you have to say.

00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:26.281
No matter how dark, dirty, foolish,
or twisted they sound,

00:55:26.364 --> 00:55:30.452
if you listen carefully to the words
that come out of my mouth,

00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:32.662
they're coming from her.

00:55:36.374 --> 00:55:37.208
That's true.

00:55:38.043 --> 00:55:40.337
Because you're also Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:45.550
Then let's start by getting you
a coffee with two sugars.

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.252
Look forward to this.

00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:26.716
I hope you're happy.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.142
If I blink my eyes right here, right now,

00:56:37.602 --> 00:56:39.187
what would you do?

00:57:40.748 --> 00:57:42.584
I'm really in Italy.

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.345
You really were waiting here.

00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:47.732
Come find me.

00:58:48.233 --> 00:58:49.317
I'll be waiting.

00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.778
I understood those words.

00:59:20.014 --> 00:59:22.141
In a short while, when that bell rings,

00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:24.394
she'll become truly happy.

00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:27.397
Trust me.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.602
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:30.872
