WEBVTT

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.639
I don't know
who I'll be traveling with yet.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.850
They refused to tell me.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.562
I've been wondering who it might be.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.982
The mystery makes this trip
that much more thrilling.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:29.696
It's like something that only happens
in movies is happening to me.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:34.242
Anyway, I'm really nervous but excited.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.253
Hold this. It's warm.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.143
I think the reason every moment

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:03.188
of our journey has been beautiful…

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.275
is that you

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.944
were a part of the scenery.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.956
But there's a scene in this movie I like,
where they go to the opera.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.336
Do you know Pretty Woman,
the movie with Julia Roberts?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.883
Next time, let's go see
that opera you memorized.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:35.762
Delicious.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.639
- Mix.
- Mix.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.808
- Yay, cheers!
- Cheers!

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:54.781
Beautiful.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.159
So much that I can't look away.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:00.829
I…

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.126
really like you, Cha Mu-hee.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.609
- Wasn't that great?
- Yeah.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.116
That's just the rough cut,
but what do you think? Romantic, huh?

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.496
When it comes to on-screen romances,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.666
viewers are used to them,
so they don't expect them to be real.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.919
Unless you really start dating
and it becomes a story, of course.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.213
But you aren't dating, are you?

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.428
To be frank, it'd be best
to broadcast the show as is,

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.514
but if this will hurt either of you,
we'll edit it.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:04.475
Sure, we had that bet on the table,

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.604
but we're not thugs
who exploit someone's genuine feelings.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.651
It's fine with me. I don't mind.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.363
Did you just… understand what I said?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.531
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.326
Wow, Hiro!
How did you get so good at Korean?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.046
To tell you the truth,

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.592
I liked you from the second time
we ran into each other.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.011
And

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.389
when I found out
you were Jin-suk's brother,

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:46.142
I felt a little awkward and embarrassed,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.479
in case you knew I'd liked you.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.648
I was always careful around you.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:55.276
In case you'd catch on.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.739
Then,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.451
Ho-jin, did you really like me?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:04.786
I did.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.208
I never thought the day would come
when I'd be telling you this.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.170
Seeing how comfortable I feel telling you,

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.674
it seems the zombie movie
I thought would never end

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.261
has finally come to an end,
once and for all.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.222
Zombie movie?

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.019
Two hours until Busan.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.482
If I'm to clear the air in that time
and avoid any misunderstandings,

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.652
I'd best start with what happened
on Enoshima Island.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.613
Right, the photo of you on that island.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.285
Mu-hee took that photo, didn't she?

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:47.870
That's right.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.416
That's where I first met her.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:53.793
There, on that day.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.717
You said you wanted revenge,
so I thought you'd ask them to cut it all.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.969
Thanks for signing off on it.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.679
No need to thank me.

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:08.099
That's not how I'll take revenge.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.144
Then how will you?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.440
I'm going to stitch you out.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.567
What?

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.235
Not that.

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.113
I'm going to snitch on you.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.075
About what?

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.829
I'm going to spill the beans
about everything.

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.749
That you hit on me.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.334
To whom?

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.419
You dummy. Who else?

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:41.924
He's great at Japanese,
so it'll be easy for me to snitch on you.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.926
Mr. Joo Ho-jin?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.053
Yeah.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.387
He already…

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:49.390
knows everything.

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.059
He does?

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.643
I told him myself.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.104
I even asked him

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.940
to help me make things work with you.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.195
You actually said all that
to the guy you like?

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.529
Are you seriously…

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:05.156
Are you stupid?

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.368
I'm not stupid.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.577
I'm crazy.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.916
Just think of me as a madwoman
like Do Ra-mi.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.795
I was planning to tease you,
but you're no fun.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.341
Hiro.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.259
You were dashing.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.888
You were even more dashing on screen.

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.056
I know.

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:36.270
That's what I thought
throughout the entire shoot.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.606
How wonderful it would be

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.193
if dating were nothing but happiness
and beautiful views

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.945
with a great guy like you.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.782
Nothing to worry or feel anxious about.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:53.413
And, at the end of it all,
we even had a happy ending.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.000
I guess that's why Do Ra-mi…

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:00.753
I mean,

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.256
why I did that to you.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.890
It's my fault.

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.768
I hit on you.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.520
It was me.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.023
I'm sorry.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.402
And thank you.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.113
You were…

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:33.578
the prince from my dreams
I longed to meet…

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.248
as an escape from my reality.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.256
Did you get that?

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:50.261
I don't know. I don't understand.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:52.889
You totally understood!

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.225
You must be a genius.
How'd you get fluent in Korean so quickly?

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.852
You're awesome.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.524
When I met you
by the clock tower in Italy,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.153
and when you asked me if I liked you…

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.283
I've wondered what might have been
if I'd just been honest and said yes.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.162
I regretted not having done so.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.460
I'm so bitter about that.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:29.550
I'm sorry.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.555
I don't understand Japanese at all.

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:42.980
You're…

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.526
an idiot.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.111
What?

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.913
My mom's here to pick me up,
so I'm heading that way.

00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:01.749
Okay, I'm going to go catch a cab.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.043
See you.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:07.296
See you.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:56.596
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.225
I heard you were looking for a place
to donate the antique books

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.644
that belonged to Mr. Yoon Won-jae.

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:07.982
I was thinking our university library
might be an apt place,

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.484
and I was looking into the matter
through Mr. Oh.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:14.155
I never imagined
you would personally step in, Mr. Kim.

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:15.656
Thank you.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.491
- You see--
- Listen.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.287
I'm not here about that.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.666
I actually came to ask you something
about your youngest brother.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.131
You came to ask about my brother
who died years ago?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.800
He left behind a daughter, no?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.845
Who you adopted.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:40.014
Is that girl…

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.352
Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.858
Yes, she is.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.820
Well, I just thought it was a little odd.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.656
Mr. Oh here told me

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.450
that he died when he was very young.

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:02.119
- From a serious illness.
- Yes, from a serious illness.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.080
But Ms. Cha Mu-hee said

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.083
her parents died in an accident.

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.126
Mr. Kim.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:13.005
Do you know Mu-hee well?

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.676
Yes, we've crossed paths.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:20.721
We dined together
and even attended a concert together.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.765
Right, we both saw her.

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:26.394
We were caught between Ms. Cha
and Mr. Yoon's grandson.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.396
- Such a cute couple.
- That's enough.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.110
Mr. Yoon's grandson is like a son to me.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.862
I was just a bit concerned.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.990
Goodness, please don't take offense.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.867
If he's like a son to you,

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.161
please dissuade him
from associating with Mu-hee.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.914
Dissuade him?

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.291
She may be adopted,

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.378
but isn't Ms. Cha Mu-hee your daughter?

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:56.424
We took her in
because she's part of our family,

00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:58.092
but even we

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.594
didn't want to let that child

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:03.097
anywhere near us.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.184
Yes.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.645
I'm at the station near my place.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.896
But it's so late.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:12.815
Not at all.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.943
The later the better,
what with fewer people around.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.863
Still, it's past midnight.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.866
Shouldn't you get to sleep early
since you work tomorrow?

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.577
Mr. Joo Ho-jin, are you tired?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:29.415
Well, you did work all day
and started early.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.000
You must be pretty tired.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.338
Still, didn't you get some shut-eye
on the train?

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:41.510
Never mind. Sleeping on the train
doesn't count as real sleep, does it?

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.265
If you're tired,
you should go home and rest.

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:57.902
I slept on the train.

00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:01.280
I'm not tired at all,
and thank you for coming to see me.

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:04.742
How did you know? Did you see me?

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.078
You kept rambling,
so I figured you were here.

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:12.833
Well, you were so late getting back.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:16.545
I came here and waited
so we wouldn't waste any time.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.589
Well done.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.510
Your hand is cold.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.637
You waited out in the cold,

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:26.972
only to leave?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.099
Well,

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.728
I didn't tell you I was coming,
so I was just going to go.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:34.188
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.278
I'm going to spell this out for you,
so listen up.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.075
I like you so much

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:50.079
that I would come see you
even after three sleepless nights.

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.086
But not four. I might drop dead.

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.551
Anywhere you want to go?

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:05.928
There's actually a place
I want to show you.

00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:22.486
I love this place.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.364
The night view isn't bad, is it?

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.034
I just wish we could have seen
the stars better.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:31.662
Do you want to see stars?

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:34.665
I know a great spot for stargazing.

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:36.333
Where?

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.879
There's something called
the International Dark Sky Association.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.631
Dark Sky Association? That's a thing?

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:46.135
They're dedicated to protecting
the beauty of the night sky

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.887
from light pollution.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:52.141
The first place they designated
as a dark-sky preserve in Asia

00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:53.684
is in Korea.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.356
Sort of like how the Michelin Guide
gives stars to go-to restaurants?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.274
Exactly.

00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:02.234
A go-to spot for stars.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.487
They say you can see the Milky Way
clearly from there.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.323
The Milky Way?

00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:10.659
I know about it,
but I've never seen it properly.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.786
- Want to go see it together?
- Sure.

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:16.665
We saw the Northern Lights,
so let's see the Milky Way too.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.670
I hope the weather is good.
I should collect more clovers.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:23.839
Sure, do your best.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.008
If you think about it,

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:30.596
being taller means
you're slightly closer to the sky.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.933
Then I guess
you'd have a better view of the stars.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.560
No way. Want to check?

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.730
Here we go!

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.654
Be careful. So, can you see them better?

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.281
I can see them much better.

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:45.421
- All right. Glasses full, ladies?
- Sure.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:48.298
Let's celebrate
Shin Ji-sun's broken engagement.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.010
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:55.264
Don't be embarrassed, okay?
Better to call it off than end in divorce.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.932
- Yeah.
- What are you saying?

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.476
You could call it off ten times over.
It means nothing.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.645
This one here got a divorce.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.604
It's fine.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.190
Hey, want me to introduce you to a guy?

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:09.111
One of my husband's friends
owns a small building in Seoul.

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.489
He's really tall and handsome too.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.283
Wanna meet him?

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.952
Forget it.
Ji-sun doesn't need us to set her up.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.581
I'm sure she's surrounded
by hot guys all the time.

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:23.083
Ji-sun, date a celebrity next time.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:26.128
- Yeah!
- A good-looking, older man.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.965
Don't you girls worry.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.300
I already met someone.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.968
- Really?
- Really?

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:33.969
Yeah!

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:38.348
He's tall, really good-looking, and young.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:39.433
He's younger than me.

00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:41.810
Shin Ji-sun, you've still got it!

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.190
- Got any pics? Show us.
- Yeah, let's see this young hunk.

00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:47.232
You wanna see him?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.442
- Yeah.
- Of course.

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:49.902
I'll show you.

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.653
- She's gonna show us.
- Let's see him.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.994
Kim Yong-u?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:02.414
I was looking for him in here,
so what's he doing over there?

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.835
Hello.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.631
I'm the young hunk she's dating.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:13.842
He is good-looking.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.427
Hello.

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.109
- Here.
- How'd this happen?

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.070
You said in your text
that you were drinking at the market.

00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:34.571
I searched the whole market.

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.366
And why exactly did you come all this way?

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.786
I came to tell you something important,

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.288
and I somehow showed up
at the perfect time.

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:50.295
When I told them

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.215
I broke off my engagement,

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:58.387
my friends were trying to comfort me,
so I was just showing off a bit.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.931
- Showing off.
- Right, I see.

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.811
Still, I'm glad
I'm someone you'd want to show off.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.148
Thanks.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.154
So what did you want to tell me?

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.078
Ms. Shin Ji-sun.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:25.873
Will you

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.958
marry me?

00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.298
What?

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.516
Let's get married.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.281
What are you waiting for?

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:02.743
Ji-sun, what are you waiting for? Say yes!

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:03.827
Go on, say yes!

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.579
- Guys, cut it out!
- Say yes!

00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:10.375
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.878
- Say yes!
- Please!

00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:17.174
Say yes!

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.222
{\an8}I know it was out of nowhere,
but I couldn't think of any other option.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:26.350
{\an8}Because I never want us to break up.

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.102
Who said we're breaking up?

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.398
I'm going to the UK
to work for a sports agency.

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:35.817
I even met my new client.

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.781
It's always been my dream,
so I can't give it up,

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.575
but I can't leave without you.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.954
What, you think I'll cheat on you
if you're not around?

00:20:47.871 --> 00:20:49.164
Would you really?

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.253
I won't ask you to come with me,
so just marry me.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:55.837
I won't.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.591
Getting married won't be necessary.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.138
Instead, let's go together.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:10.644
After the show, I was planning
to take a year off to study.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.398
I'd planned it
while preparing for the wedding,

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:18.110
and even after calling off the engagement,
I was going to stick to the plan.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:23.448
I had planned to study in the US,
but I can just go to a different country.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.993
And you hadn't told me?

00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:30.956
I'd been hesitating because of you.

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.127
I thought maybe
I should give up on my plan,

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.714
but then wondered
if I was getting ahead of myself…

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.802
Thank you for hesitating for my sake.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.899
I caught your strong dialect earlier.
I was impressed.

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.193
I speak two languages.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.696
My mom's Busan dialect
and Dad's Seoul dialect.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:04.740
What about English?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.117
You seemed pretty fluent last time.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:08.952
Gee…

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:10.829
H…

00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:39.107
I sleep well these days even without meds,
and I don't see Do Ra-mi.

00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:43.653
But I wonder
why I don't see Do Ra-mi anymore.

00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:46.865
I've given it some thought,

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:52.621
and I shared a lifelong secret
with someone I deeply rely on.

00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:54.790
I think that might be why.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.875
What kind of secret was it?

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.211
It's about my childhood.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.091
Then perhaps Do Ra-mi is related
to your childhood, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.595
Do Ra-mi couldn't have existed
when I was a kid.

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:11.515
Perhaps you only thought it was Do Ra-mi

00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:14.059
because your symptoms began
after filming that movie.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:16.937
Was the person you were seeing

00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:19.356
really Do Ra-mi?

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:30.158
I was sure it was Do Ra-mi,
but he said it might not be her.

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.370
Didn't she tell you herself
that she was Do Ra-mi?

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.623
She said everything came
from your own head.

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:39.709
Maybe she said that
because it's what you believed.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.170
She looked like me, was terrifying,

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:45.298
and kept criticizing me.
Naturally, I thought she was Do Ra-mi.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:47.968
Are you still at the hospital?

00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:51.346
No, I'm shopping for Yong-u's present.

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.766
I feel like I'm sending away
my baby brother.

00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.519
- Are you at home, Ho-jin?
- Yes.

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.771
I'm waiting for a guest.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:00.689
A guest?

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:02.899
The novelist?

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:04.568
No.

00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:06.611
I'll tell you about it next time.

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:10.157
What do you mean "next time"?
See you this evening.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:25.547
Perhaps you didn't emerge
due to a rapid change in her environment

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.507
but from a much deeper

00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:31.428
and darker past.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.484
Do you have this in a larger size?

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.652
- Sure, let me check for you.
- Thank you.

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.119
Picking out a present?

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:13.595
I heard that Mr. Yoon
had quite a formidable collection,

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:15.430
but seeing it in person,

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.183
it's even more impressive than I imagined.

00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:22.312
I heard you had something
you insisted on telling me in person.

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:23.772
Right.

00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:28.902
First, I wanted to ask you
to consider donating to our foundation.

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:31.655
Everything here is my mother's.
It's not mine to give away.

00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:38.286
It seems Mu-hee has given you
an unfavorable impression of us.

00:25:39.454 --> 00:25:42.874
I wonder just how terribly you treated her
to assume that right away.

00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.711
We were fairly strict with her.

00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:51.424
She's a cunning girl, apt at telling lies
depending on the circumstances.

00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:54.261
Sounds like she was a clever person
who caught on fast

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:59.224
to the fact that she could never be honest
in a place shrouded by lies.

00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:09.985
You pretended to be selfless as a child,

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:13.655
but now that you're somewhat famous,
you seem to want things out of your reach.

00:26:16.157 --> 00:26:18.243
I'm not just somewhat famous.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.579
I've earned so much money

00:26:21.496 --> 00:26:23.582
that these things
are well within my reach.

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:26.626
Now you're the very image of her.

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.337
What do you mean?

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:34.718
Your uncle has gone to meet
the maternal grandson of Mr. Yoon Won-jae.

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.139
We had no choice
but to tell him about you.

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:42.309
His family could be of great help to us.

00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.729
Don't try to own things
that don't suit you

00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:49.065
simply because things are starting
to look up for you.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:55.196
Aunt.

00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:05.957
The woman who gave birth to Mu-hee
was not family.

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:11.921
My brother never married that woman.

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:15.592
She tried to use that child
to stop him from leaving her.

00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:18.803
And when that didn't work out
like she'd hoped,

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:21.514
she caused a huge tragedy
in an attempt to ruin everything.

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.518
That's the kind of mother she had.

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.563
It's a shameful part of our history

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:30.732
that we wanted to keep hidden.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.071
I heard you were quite close to her.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.200
I requested to meet
because I had to share this with you.

00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:43.119
If that were the case,
you shouldn't have come all this way.

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:45.997
Mu-hee already told me everything.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.628
She told you about herself?

00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:55.006
He already knows. I told him everything.

00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:58.593
You told him?

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:01.346
I told him. Everything.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.057
Everything?

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:13.983
I knew it.

00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:19.322
So you do remember
what happened to your parents that day.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.039
I was simply terrified.

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:33.336
I told you I didn't remember
because I was scared you'd kick me out.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.507
I remember everything.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.390
Happy birthday, Mu-hee.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:30.518
Mu-hee.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.187
You should eat some too.

00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:36.065
Let's all be happy together.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.737
That woman laced
her daughter's birthday cake with poison

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:43.072
and tried to die with her.

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:47.243
Perhaps the girl refused and tried to run

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.454
because she fell off the balcony.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.792
She said she had no memories
of that horrid incident,

00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:57.045
which we thought was a relief.

00:29:58.671 --> 00:30:00.131
You turned your back on her.

00:30:01.758 --> 00:30:03.009
Ever since she was a child,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.513
Ms. Cha Mu-hee has carried
the weight of those awful memories

00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:09.224
entirely on her own.

00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.227
I pitied her, yes,
but she was her daughter.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.853
She made our skin crawl.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.362
There's only one photo I didn't destroy.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.118
I intended to show it to Mu-hee
if she ever brought up her mom.

00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:32.163
See for yourself
why we find that girl so terrifying.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:35.792
It wasn't my fault.

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.545
So why did you

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.421
hate me so much?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.009
We were afraid.

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:47.720
We were so afraid of you.

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:51.391
If you remember,

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:55.228
you must also remember your mom.

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.275
Then again,

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:02.735
there's no way you couldn't.

00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:07.198
Seeing that face in the mirror every day,

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:11.536
you couldn't possibly forget your mom.

00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:39.105
Mom.

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:47.488
She looked like me, was terrifying,
and kept criticizing me.

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:49.866
Naturally, I thought she was Do Ra-mi.

00:31:58.791 --> 00:32:02.128
If that face wasn't Do Ra-mi's,
then whose could it be?

00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:16.684
It was my mom.

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:19.479
Do Ra-mi

00:32:20.688 --> 00:32:22.440
had my mom's face.

00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.695
At last, you recognize me.

00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:31.866
Here.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.202
Let's all be happy now.

00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.245
You should eat some too.

00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:42.627
I don't want to.

00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:46.673
The chicks died after eating the cake.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.716
And Dad too.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.677
You want to be left behind all alone?

00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:55.556
Why?

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:57.600
There would be no one

00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:00.561
left in this world to love you.

00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:03.982
You could never be happy.

00:33:04.524 --> 00:33:05.692
I still don't want it.

00:33:29.132 --> 00:33:30.008
Mom.

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:51.070
That day,

00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:54.574
I never fully managed
to get away from my mom.

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:58.453
Her words that I'd never be happy

00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:01.998
kept coming back to me,
no matter how hard I tried to erase them,

00:34:02.498 --> 00:34:05.293
and haunted me my entire life.

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.427
So this time, I must use all I have

00:34:14.927 --> 00:34:16.804
to try once more

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:20.600
to truly break free from this delusion.

00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:23.603
Please try your darndest

00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.855
so I can finally get lost.

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:28.733
Goodbye.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.870
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:43.081
I love you.

00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.386
Ms. Cha Mu-hee, are you with us?

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:22.537
You were out for three days.
I was so worried, Mu-hee.

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.457
I thought you'd be out for a while,
like last time.

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:30.670
Hey, I'm fine.

00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:32.672
Even the doctor said I'm fine.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.592
I contacted Mr. Joo.

00:35:36.676 --> 00:35:38.928
He's on his way,
so he should be here soon.

00:35:39.011 --> 00:35:39.846
He will?

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:45.518
Hey, give me a mirror.
I haven't washed my hair.

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:46.602
I guess you're back.

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:48.396
Thank goodness.

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.398
It would've killed Mr. Joo otherwise.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:53.568
He couldn't stay here,

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.362
what with all the reporters
and the show's crew visiting.

00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:58.781
He was withering away at home,
unable to sleep.

00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:52.668
Hiro!

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:55.963
Ms. Cha Mu-hee is awake.

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.215
Really? Is she okay?

00:36:57.298 --> 00:37:00.885
I spoke to Mr. Kim Yong-u on the phone,
and he said she's well.

00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:05.056
I knew it.

00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:08.768
There's no way
a zombie would die so easily.

00:37:10.144 --> 00:37:11.437
Oh no. I'm exhausted.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.898
Hey, are you okay?

00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:18.527
You've spent three days
going at it with that punching bag.

00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:21.739
I was worried you might collapse too.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.116
I won't collapse from this!

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:30.623
Take this off.
I don't have the strength to do it myself.

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:40.675
Your hands are trembling.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.678
- I'm fine.
- You shouldn't overexert yourself.

00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:48.683
This is all that zombie's fault.

00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:52.186
When I see her,
I'm going to get my revenge.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.897
Why are you always going on about revenge?

00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:16.127
We really do look alike.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:20.172
She's not the same person as you,
Ms. Cha Mu-hee. Not at all.

00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.469
I know.

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:31.142
Mu-hee.

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.479
There's something you still don't know.

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:50.995
That day,

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:54.248
on your birthday,

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.460
someone reported that a child had fallen,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.087
so the police entered your home.

00:39:01.255 --> 00:39:04.258
Thanks to that,
your parents were found and saved.

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:08.721
Then…

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.434
They're still alive.

00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:21.400
The father you thought had passed away
was actually your youngest uncle.

00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:23.486
So your father

00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:26.530
is actually your uncle who lives abroad.

00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.578
I had no idea.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.833
Even as a kid,
I didn't get to see my dad very often,

00:39:39.418 --> 00:39:41.545
so I had no idea what he looked like.

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.633
Apparently, no one knows the whereabouts
of your mother since the incident,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.177
but she's definitely alive.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.891
Then why did they tell me…

00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:57.978
that both of them died that day?

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.568
You said you didn't remember the incident,

00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:07.905
so they covered up the events of that day.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.867
Your father's family deceived you.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.715
So they were alive.

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:26.043
I desperately wanted to join this project,
so I shot that in a hurry.

00:42:26.126 --> 00:42:27.962
Thank you for your kind words.

00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:51.569
I prepared some words to say on my own,
without an interpreter.

00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:26.687
You've changed, Hiro.

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.440
You've matured.

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.427
Your father said
he couldn't bear to see you,

00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:01.639
so we had no choice but to take you in.

00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:05.392
I'm not here to blame you.

00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:10.272
I came to ask you for a favor.

00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:16.070
The only one who can find out
where my mom is now

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.321
is, in the end,

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.199
my father, who was closest to her.

00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:25.162
Please ask that man…

00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:29.083
to at least find that out for me.

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:32.961
You're going to meet your mom?

00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:37.549
I need to see that she's alive
with my own two eyes.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.344
I think it's the only way
to be truly free of her.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.681
All right.

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:52.606
I have to say I'm a little worried.

00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:56.068
Don't you worry.

00:44:56.151 --> 00:44:57.569
There's always Papago.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.989
And it's Koreatown,
so I won't even need to use Papago.

00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:03.992
I could go with you, you know.

00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:07.663
Not as an interpreter,
but just as moral support.

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.127
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:15.879
I told myself

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.632
that we'll never have a happy ending.

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:23.679
So you, not wanting me to be anxious,

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:28.851
said all that nonsense about how it's fine
'cause we'll definitely break up.

00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:35.858
I don't want us to definitely break up.

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:38.944
So let's…

00:45:42.698 --> 00:45:45.075
break up right here this time.

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:55.210
I'll come back and threaten you
into dating me again.

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:57.379
When I do,

00:45:58.505 --> 00:46:01.675
please give in so we can be happy together
for a very long time.

00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:12.853
I'm not one to give in to threats.

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:15.481
You'd better come prepared
and bring your worst.

00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:17.566
I will.

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.073
I wonder how she's doing.

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:10.577
Can I pack some of your gochujang
to bring to the UK?

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.454
Your housekeeper makes it so well.

00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:14.081
Sure. Take some.

00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:15.958
Hey, Mr. Joo.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.795
Can I take some soy sauce too?

00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.630
Go on.

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.423
Where was it again?

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:25.968
Under the sink…

00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:27.719
- The sink?
- I'll find it for you.

00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:28.804
No, it's okay.

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:33.183
Why did he bring that pot in from outside…

00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:37.312
- Found it?
- Found it.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.273
- A container…
- Take it.

00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:41.316
- Mr. Joo, I--
- Just take it all!

00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:42.651
All of it.

00:47:44.653 --> 00:47:47.447
Ji-sun's rubbing off on you
in all sorts of weird ways.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.995
Why did you bring this bag here?

00:47:59.084 --> 00:48:00.002
Give them to me.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:04.298
I'll be donating my father's books
to the university library,

00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:09.094
but let's think about what to do
with the other antiques and paintings.

00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:12.264
Can't you deal with them all
while you're here?

00:48:12.347 --> 00:48:16.685
Hey, those are all invaluable pieces.
I can't sort through them all in one go.

00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:19.855
I'll take my time with it
over several visits.

00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:21.940
And keep using this house
as a storage unit?

00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:23.692
Why?

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.654
Do you want to sell this house
and buy an apartment for marriage?

00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:31.742
Hey.

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.954
Can I have this book?

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:37.331
- It's yours.
- Really?

00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:40.250
Then

00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:42.502
how about this one?

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.545
As you wish.

00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:45.339
That's a first edition Dickens.

00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:47.799
Oh my, not the Dickens.

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:49.593
- Just let me have it.
- I'll take that.

00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:51.094
Hey, no take-backs!

00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:54.848
- Why have you gotten so greedy?
- You wouldn't even take good care of them!

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:55.974
I will.

00:48:56.058 --> 00:48:57.184
Hold up!

00:48:57.267 --> 00:49:01.063
First, you toy with someone's heart,
and now you're doing the same with a book.

00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.238
Sell this house and move…

00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.661
But Ms. Cha Mu-hee liked this house.

00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:44.231
This year, we're all celebrating
New Year's Eve together.

00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:45.941
You'll join us, won't you?

00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:48.527
- Sure.
- We'll be expecting you.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.196
So the whole gang is coming this time?

00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:53.865
Of course. Everyone will be there.

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:57.452
Can't you bring your girlfriend with you?

00:49:58.537 --> 00:49:59.454
I can't.

00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:01.540
We're broken up right now.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.002
Come on. You got dumped again?

00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:09.965
I'm off.

00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:14.970
Hey, it's okay if you're late,
so join us instead of staying home alone.

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.555
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.778
You're the absolute best.

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:32.904
Everyone!

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:33.989
Today's the day

00:50:34.072 --> 00:50:38.118
we submitted the final cut
of Romantic Trip!

00:50:40.328 --> 00:50:45.417
We almost missed the deadline.
The penalty is a couple hundred million.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.254
My hands were trembling
as I was typing out the captions.

00:50:49.337 --> 00:50:50.881
You'd better toughen up a little.

00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:55.052
Once it airs and the ratings are in,
your whole body will be shaking.

00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:56.386
Oh, come on…

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.680
I'm not worried. Our show's great.

00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:00.098
Of course you're not worried.

00:51:00.182 --> 00:51:03.727
You're running away to the UK
before the numbers come out.

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:05.062
She's right.

00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:07.898
- Hey, what's that?
- What's that?

00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:10.734
Which is why I'm buying tonight.

00:51:12.277 --> 00:51:15.447
Despite the producer changing
partway through filming,

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.449
you all did a great job.

00:51:17.532 --> 00:51:19.910
- Shall we raise a glass?
- Let's raise a glass!

00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:22.287
Hello, everyone!

00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.998
- Welcome.
- Hey, you're here!

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:27.501
I heard you turned in the cut.
Good work, all.

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:28.543
It was nothing.

00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:31.713
Our show is going to be a huge hit.
You know that, right?

00:51:33.965 --> 00:51:35.592
Our company card. Today's on me.

00:51:35.675 --> 00:51:37.177
- Okay!
- Wow!

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.305
Hey, so you show up like this
out of nowhere?

00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:42.349
Man, I was so shocked.

00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:44.768
You're going to ride on our coattails?

00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:47.938
He'll start with the tails,
then just wear the coat.

00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:51.149
Didn't you see this coming?
This is how Producer Kim plays the game.

00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.859
- Right.
- Merry Christmas!

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.862
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.405
Thanks for dinner!

00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:49.416
Babe.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.169
Want to go see the stars with me?

00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:55.505
What a succinct but effective threat.

00:53:07.225 --> 00:53:10.437
Welcome, and thank you
for visiting our observatory.

00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:12.731
The International Dark Sky Association,

00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:16.735
dedicated to protecting the night sky
from artificial light,

00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:20.488
certified this site
as Asia's first dark-sky preserve.

00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:23.950
Here, you can observe celestial wonders
like the Milky Way

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.536
and shooting stars with the naked eye.

00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:29.956
As the lights go out
and darkness settles in,

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.668
the stars will begin to appear one by one.

00:53:34.252 --> 00:53:37.088
We hope you have
an unforgettable night here

00:53:37.172 --> 00:53:40.383
at our observatory with someone special.

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:51.478
Have you come to see the stars?

00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:08.286
You need to do a good job
interpreting today.

00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:12.666
He might be really mad at me
because I took so long.

00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:15.543
Please translate with all your heart.

00:54:19.714 --> 00:54:21.174
I've missed you.

00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:29.140
I guess English doesn't work on him.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.269
Let's try Japanese.

00:54:36.648 --> 00:54:38.316
I really missed you.

00:54:45.031 --> 00:54:46.866
Does he still not understand me?

00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:58.503
I missed you so much.

00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:01.506
So much that it almost killed me.

00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:18.648
Why aren't you reacting?
You understood everything.

00:55:21.192 --> 00:55:23.153
Why aren't you saying anything back?

00:55:25.947 --> 00:55:27.240
Are you really mad at me?

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:35.915
I was having trouble
finding the right words to reply with.

00:55:39.252 --> 00:55:40.920
"Have you come to see the stars?"

00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:49.304
I even brought a bouquet of clovers…

00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:53.892
so that we'd have clear skies.

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:04.402
If you're mad at me, you can swear at me.

00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:07.655
If you'd rather not talk,

00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:11.659
you can use a universal language.

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:15.205
Sure.

00:56:16.414 --> 00:56:17.415
That option

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.085
seems most appropriate.

00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:44.335
Finally,

00:57:45.503 --> 00:57:47.297
we've reached our happy ending.

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.133
Wait.

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.635
Let's change the music.

00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:57.015
Because our ending
will be a perfectly happy one.

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:14.782
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:40.053
