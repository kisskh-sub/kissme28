WEBVTT

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:09.926
Stand by.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.770
Let's start the preinterviews
for Romantic Trip.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.688
Slate.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.320
I don't know
who I'll be traveling with yet.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.448
They refused to tell me.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.201
I've been wondering who it might be.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.079
The mystery makes this trip
that much more thrilling.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.000
Frankly speaking, it's not every day
that you meet a foreigner,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.543
an attractive woman, no less,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.670
who doesn't speak your language,

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.631
in a foreign country,
let alone end up traveling together.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.677
It's like something that only happens
in movies is happening to me.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.306
Anyway, I'm really nervous but excited.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.267
So I'll be meeting her soon.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.312
I hope she's not disappointed
when she sees me.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.608
I hope it will be a wonderful trip.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.902
This is who you'll be traveling with.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.904
You're telling me now? Right here?

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:11.905
Here you go. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.532
I'm nervous.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.496
{\an8}Hello.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.541
{\an8}I'm Kurosawa Hiro, an actor from Japan.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.877
{\an8}See you in Canada.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.088
Oh, it's him.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.091
I ran into him once at a film festival.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:35.136
{\an8}Hello. I'm Cha Mu-hee, a Korean actress.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.183
Do Ra-mi?

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.145
Am I right?

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.399
I see.

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:53.404
Do Ra-mi…

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.782
See you in Canada.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:14.884
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.097
CANADA

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:57.969
Sweet.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.391
Is Mu-hee really comfortable
staying in the same place as the crew?

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.185
I told you we'd book her a hotel.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.353
We booked a hotel room for Hiro.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.272
She says she'd be more comfortable here.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.150
But we won't be filming anything here.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:13.860
Sorry?

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.070
If she's thinking
we're gonna get footage of her

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:19.282
being all down-to-earth
and buddying up with the crew,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.160
she'd be better off going to a hotel
than staying here.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:26.789
She's not confident with English
and would rather be surrounded by Koreans.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.044
So she's the type to go to LA
and stay in Koreatown?

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.170
I totally relate.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.298
It would be nice to be nearby.
It'd make our meetings easier.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.425
I think it'd be a bit of a pain.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.471
I'm already managing the whole crew.
Now I need to cater to the actress too?

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.932
Please rest assured.
I'll take care of her.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.518
And I brought tons of cup noodles
and snacks from Korea.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.063
Whenever you want any, just let me know.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.192
- Ta-da.
- My God! What is it?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.611
Did you rob a supermarket?

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.529
Is all of this food?

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.406
Yes, Korean soul food.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.118
Producer Park, I know you can't live
without Korean cuisine.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.835
Well, okay. Sure.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.297
You can room with Mr. Joo like you wanted.
It's the biggest room.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.300
You didn't bring any Neoguri?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.552
Thank you!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.774
Watching it back, I was totally out of it.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.194
No wonder I didn't recognize him
at the after-party.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.906
Kurosawa Hiro's nickname in Japan
is the "Prince of Romance."

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.909
Let's make Prince Hiro's heart
beat so fast that he has a heart attack.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.704
Don't say stuff like that.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.207
I killed so many people as Do Ra-mi
that I want to shed that image.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.042
I didn't mean kill him like this.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.378
I meant like this.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:01.384
Like this?

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.346
No, not like that.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.434
More like the pure-hearted heroine
of a Japanese coming-of-age movie.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.648
Hiro-kun?

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:21.112
See? I knew you could do it!

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:24.115
Okay, I'll try my best.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.746
I wonder if Hiro-kun
has landed in Canada yet.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.792
Probably. Should I reach out to Mr. Joo?
He's coming with the Japan crew.

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:36.461
Mr. Joo Ho-jin?

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:39.630
Never mind.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.550
If you reach out,
it'll look like I'm waiting for him.

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.136
Yeah, let's not. It'll hurt my pride too.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.513
Get some rest, then.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.891
I'm just next door. Call if you need me.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.559
Hey.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.437
You said you're sharing a room
with Mr. Joo, right?

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.565
So does that mean
Mr. Joo is also next door?

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.317
Mu-hee-chan! Snap out of it.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.693
Think only of Hiro-kun.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.653
Yes!

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:13.414
Yeah, I should snap out of it.
Mr. Joo's here to work, after all.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.760
In any case, we ended up
coming on this trip together.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.403
It's freezing.

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:53.371
Sorry about that.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.712
Mr. Joo, can I have a quick word?

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.631
Could you watch our bags?

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:09.137
We almost didn't make it to Canada.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.806
Thanks to you,
we managed to coax him into coming.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.226
You're the one who did the coaxing.
I merely interpreted.

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.520
He thought
it'd be one of the proposed names.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:20.857
Do Ra-mi appeared out of nowhere.
No wonder he was shocked.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.609
Do Ra-mi's public image is
rather horrifying.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.821
Did you not discuss her casting
with Hiro and his team at all?

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.614
We did with his agency.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:33.119
They approved it because they thought
Do Ra-mi's global fame would benefit Hiro.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.706
In any case, thank goodness
our crew doesn't speak Japanese.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.794
It means only you and I
are aware of this situation.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.923
So you intend to cover this up?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.009
We're basically filming them
going on dates.

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.136
The theme of our show is romance.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.973
What woman would be into a guy
who says he has no interest in dating her?

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.933
Don't you think that'd
make her dislike him more?

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:56.851
That's true.

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.061
Telling her would disrupt their romance.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.147
Wait, do you wish
to disrupt their romance?

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.607
- No.
- All right, then.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.319
This stays between you and me.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.989
You can't tell her because you're buddies
or whatever, okay?

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.575
I don't gossip about what I hear
while interpreting.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.161
Fortunately, Do Ra-mi doesn't
understand Japanese.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:19.957
If Hiro crosses the line with his words,
filter them instead of interpreting them.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.292
Like an edit.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.962
As the lead producer, I give you
the authority to edit their conversations.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:27.965
No, thank you.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.635
My job is to interpret words as they are.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:33.721
As the director,
please make any necessary edits yourself.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.641
I'm just asking for your help
since you and Do Ra-mi are close.

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.644
And why do you keep calling her Do Ra-mi?

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.396
Everyone was calling her Do Ra-mi
earlier too.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.357
Her name is Cha Mu-hee.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.274
I know.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.568
But Do Ra-mi is famous.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.819
And it's catchier.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.697
If you call someone by the wrong name,
it makes my job harder.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.658
Please call her by her name.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.493
Okay.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.130
Welcome.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.549
- Have you settled in?
- Yes.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.175
Thanks.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.262
I unpacked in the smaller bedroom.
You should use the big one.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.180
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.143
Hey, what's all this?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.271
Just food. You should have some too.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.773
I have everything
from ramyeon to the latest snacks.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.777
This. I lined up at the convenience store
first thing to buy it. Wanna try?

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.782
Strawberry flavor?

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.952
You met Hiro, didn't you? How is he?

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.413
I bet he's really excited Mu-hee was cast.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.839
What about Ms. Cha Mu-hee?
She knows who he is. Is she fine with it?

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:53.884
She's over the moon. He's good-looking,
and his image is that of a gentleman.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.348
So Ms. Cha likes Hiro's public image?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.267
Of course.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.978
The two of them actually met before.

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.147
Hiro was really kind to Mu-hee back then.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:08.858
He was kind to her?

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.655
So they're already kind of into each other
going into the shoot.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:17.408
Right, I see.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.956
So that's what Ms. Cha Mu-hee thinks.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.463
Mr. Joo was curious about me?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.382
Probably because you asked questions.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.300
Not at all.

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.720
All I did was ask how Hiro was,
and he brought it up first,

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.930
asking what you think about Hiro.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:41.682
He did?

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.020
So what did you say?

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:48.814
That the two of you have met before
and are into each other.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.400
When he heard that, his face…

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.110
Why? What is it?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.406
I'm not sure whether to describe it
as a worried look

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.283
or a disgruntled look.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.618
Something in between.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.830
Why would he be worried?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.292
Why would he be disgruntled
to hear I'm into Hiro?

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.463
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:15.716
How did the meeting
for the first shoot go?

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:21.681
Producer Kim suggested
I plan a surprise event for Hiro-kun,

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.599
so I said I'd come up with something.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:24.934
A surprise event?

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.353
Sounds good. Let's plan something awesome.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.273
Yong-u.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.651
- Can I see you for a sec?
- Sure.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.195
- Go get some rest.
- Okay.

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:41.534
I just wanted to check
if this was ready for tomorrow's shoot.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.473
Yong-u.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.978
Yong-u, are you in there?

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.607
Hey, one second.

00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:15.985
Oh my, Mr. Joo Ho-jin?

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.279
This is Yong-u's room.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:24.702
Yeah. Well, I'm sharing a room with him.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.956
Is that right? I just came to see Yong-u.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.501
My room is right over here. Just here.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.171
I know. I was just about to come over.

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:38.883
Why?

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:44.346
Yong-u called to say he's got your phone.
You left it after talking to him just now.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.810
Yong-u's on the line.
Here. Talk to him yourself.

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:56.734
Hey, Yong-u.

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.153
I heard everything. What's wrong with you?

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.238
Okay, got it. Hold onto my phone. Bye.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.630
Seems like you've managed to find Yong-u,

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:22.009
and now I have no reason
to come to your room.

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:26.055
So what now?

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.475
Yeah, I used Yong-u as an excuse.

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.144
If I came to see you
knowing you were alone,

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.774
I thought you might get scared
or think I was threatening you.

00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:38.734
Oh, I'm so scared.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.364
I came to ask you something.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.534
But forget it. Good night.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.079
Let's go. We can talk outside.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.040
Or we could just talk in your room.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.585
The idea of inviting you inside

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.712
is just too terrifying.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.840
Petrifying.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.857
What did they serve you on the plane?
I got bibimbap.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.861
You flew from Japan,
so did you get sushi? Donburi? Tempura?

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:26.073
Tempura means deep-fried food
in Japanese, right? Or maybe not.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.910
Tempura does mean deep-fried food.
I was served donburi on the plane.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.787
And if that's just awkward rambling,

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:35.082
why don't we start with hello
since it's been a while?

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:39.753
How have you been?

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.967
I've been busy, but good.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.385
You?

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.348
What happened with the wedding?

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.934
The wedding's next week.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.478
I used this show as an excuse to avoid it.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.316
Things will get busy
once we start shooting tomorrow.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.651
Next week will fly by in a blur.

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:07.114
By the way,

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.743
how's the Do Ra-mi issue been lately?

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.454
She's still here.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.207
I've been thinking about her,

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.752
and she's like a hateful comment.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:20.961
A hateful comment?

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:26.342
If things go my way, she scoffs and asks,
"You really think you can keep this up?"

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.261
And if things don't go well, she says,
"Serves you right."

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:32.264
She's like an online troll.
I wish I could sue her.

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.767
But I can't because she lives up here.

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.561
So I plan on just ignoring her.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.941
If she lives up there, as you say,

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.652
that means you're your own hater.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.614
I am my own hater?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.535
Oh, is that how it works out?

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.414
Tell me more about those hateful comments.

00:15:57.498 --> 00:16:00.459
What exactly does Do Ra-mi say to you?

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.840
In any case,
we ended up coming here together.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:14.223
You're all giddy, using me as an excuse to
get him here to see the Northern Lights.

00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:17.476
Now he's the hunk next door.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:22.106
If he's next door, you'll run into
each other every day, eat together…

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.483
And together, you'll…

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.780
How can I tell you that stuff in detail?

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.659
I'm the only one who knows.
You wanted help, so I should know more.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.246
If everything Do Ra-mi says
is what I'm thinking,

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.998
how do you expect me
to share that with you?

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.709
It'd be like letting you read my diary.
No way.

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:45.462
Why not?

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.008
Because there are entries about me?

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:51.760
I don't know.

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:54.346
How can you not know? You wrote them.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.390
I bet you cursed me out.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.813
Do you really think it was just curses?
We're talking about Do Ra-mi.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:05.649
If you knew,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.944
you'd be too scared
to be alone with me tonight.

00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:12.990
Why? Like what?

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.285
Relax.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.173
Hiro?

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.051
What is it?

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:15.385
Why are you here?

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.763
I was waiting to tell you
about tomorrow's shoot.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:19.556
Are you all right?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.474
What's that?

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:24.728
The hotel sent a welcome cake and flowers.
Want some?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.647
Ever seen me eat anything at night?

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.567
A slice of shortcake has 600 calories.
That'd be two hours on the treadmill.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.195
Why is it so cold here this time of year?

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:37.241
I told you repeatedly that fall in Canada
is colder than winter in Japan.

00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.910
- Shall I turn up the heater?
- No, it'll get too dry.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.580
My eyes are already so dry,
they might pop out any minute.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.999
What do you need to tell me?

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:51.255
They're asking if you prepared
a surprise gift for your first meeting.

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:53.173
Not likely.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:56.552
Are they asking
because she's prepared something?

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:57.970
I believe so.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:06.019
Fine. Then tell them
I'll prepare something too.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:08.814
I guess I'll party with the zombie.

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.779
Are you still mad she didn't recognize you
that night and taking it out on her?

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.366
Sure, she was rude,

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.911
but do I look like a jerk
who'd hold such a petty grudge?

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:27.541
I asked you a question.
Why aren't you answering me?

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.168
Fine, I'll take your word for it.

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.297
I just don't like her public image.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.426
You hate Do Ra-mi's zombie image
that much?

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:41.430
Prince Hiro, who'd smile like the sun,
even before a zombie.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.434
That's the image I hate.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:20:00.073
Have a bite of something sweet.
It'll make you feel better.

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.408
I'll leave it here.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:19.218
Hearts, huh?

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:33.106
Come on, tell me what Hiro said about me.

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:35.943
Why ask the interpreter?

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.361
Go talk to the director.

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:40.864
Before a blind date, it's normal
to ask the organizer a bunch of questions.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:43.283
Why is this a blind date,
and why did I set it up?

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.827
Although it's a shoot, it's still a date,

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.830
and you're the one
who'll connect his words and mine.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:52.000
In other words,
you're our messenger of love.

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:54.044
So what'd he say about me?

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:56.463
If so, all the more reason
for me to stay silent.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.048
I don't want to muddy the waters.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:03.011
Well, why were you so disgruntled, then?

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.055
Who? Me?

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.807
That's what Yong-u said.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.977
He said you seemed disgruntled
when he told you I was into Hiro.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:12.229
Yong-u misspoke.

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:13.730
See?

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:16.275
If the messenger misinterprets
a message based on personal bias,

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.486
it can lead to
a ridiculous misunderstanding.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.951
Then can you interpret
without any emotion whatsoever?

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:30.247
If we act all cutesy and lovey-dovey,
won't it get to you?

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.832
My job is to listen to you two

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.668
and translate Korean into Japanese
and vice versa.

00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:38.005
Whatever you two do or say
won't affect me emotionally.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:39.923
Good to know.

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:45.679
I was worried about… crossing the line
and making you feel embarrassed.

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.932
But I guess I can act all cheesy
without any problems.

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.310
Why would I be embarrassed…

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.648
Beats me.

00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:08.493
If you have any questions,
you should ask Producer Kim.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:13.415
The crew's priority is the show,
so they'd tell me whatever serves it.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:17.085
I asked you because we're closer,

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.296
and I thought you were on my side.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.010
Pretty, right?

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.973
I'm going to make a heart
out of these leaves tomorrow.

00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:32.267
A like on Instagram is a heart.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:37.022
So I'm giving Hiro a heart that means,
"Here's a like for our first meeting."

00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:39.900
What's "heart" in Japanese?

00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:42.110
They call it "heart" in Japan too.

00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:46.156
Of course. So hearts are universal?

00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:02.339
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.260
What you said earlier,

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:09.763
I think you're right.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.891
That I'm making hateful comments
about myself.

00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:18.271
Remember how I told you
this was my festival?

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:19.815
Well,

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:23.318
I'm kind of scared
that once the fireworks have stopped

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.320
and the crowd has died down,

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:29.032
I'll be left all alone once more.

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:31.910
Left

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:33.995
with nothing.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.419
That must be why Do Ra-mi keeps appearing
and leaving those hateful comments.

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:42.754
"You're sad. A loser.
You're destined to fail."

00:23:50.887 --> 00:23:51.972
Don't agree with her.

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.602
None of those things will happen
if you don't let them.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.274
I won't.

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:08.405
I said I'd help you,
but I'm not sure what I can do.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.743
I can't see or hear Do Ra-mi
since she's inside your head.

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:17.164
Didn't you say you'd root for me?

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:22.919
You said you wouldn't ask me out
but still root for me. You're doing great.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.843
You're the only one who knows
about the hater inside my head.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:34.264
So keep rooting for Cha Mu-hee
just like you are now.

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:36.475
For her to not let Do Ra-mi win.

00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:39.644
Okay, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:42.689
Please win.

00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:45.942
Go Cha Mu-hee!

00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:50.822
Here. Try giving a proper cheer.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.412
Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:24:58.371 --> 00:24:59.206
Well…

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.835
Mu-hee!

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:09.549
He'll tease me, saying I was
hitting on you again. I'll head inside.

00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:13.178
Good night, neighbor.

00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:16.848
Where's my phone?

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:18.433
Right here.

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:20.977
I was just asking him about Hiro.

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:22.687
Yeah, I bet you were.

00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:44.042
Producer Kim.

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.547
Hello? Why doesn't he have
his walkie-talkie?

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.673
Oh, hi.

00:25:55.595 --> 00:25:56.763
Mu-hee!

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:59.516
- Good morning.
- Oh my God, you look pretty.

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:01.643
- How are you feeling?
- Great.

00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:03.937
As for the cameras,

00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:07.023
we'll try to make them
as discreet as possible.

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:08.525
And as for the footage,

00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:14.114
we'll be watching everything
from production headquarters over there.

00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:15.282
Got it.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.411
You'll hear the interpreter
through your earpiece.

00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:21.454
In today's script…

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.752
Can you lower the drone
and focus in on Ms. Cha Mu-hee?

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:29.337
Good.

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:37.137
Shouldn't we switch up the drone angle
to a close-up shot of her?

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.972
- Switch these two?
- Yeah.

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.985
Mr. Joo, can you hear me?

00:26:53.653 --> 00:26:54.738
Yes, I can hear you.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.740
I can hear you too.

00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:02.996
Yes, it's ready.

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:08.209
Even the weather's perfect.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.006
All right, cameras, to your positions.

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:15.425
Drone, start tracking him.

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:22.349
Starting the first shoot of Romantic Trip.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.184
Let's do this.

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:29.022
All right. Drone, please zoom in
on Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:43.036
Okay, now please track Hiro.

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.475
Nice to meet you.

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.229
Hello.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.482
I'm headed your way.

00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:19.280
I'm… sitting under a huge maple tree.

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.491
Do you think you can find me?

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.042
I see you sitting on a bench.

00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:32.711
Really?

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:35.588
You can see me?

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:40.427
Where are you?

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:42.637
Why don't you come find me?

00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:44.180
Sorry?

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.227
It wouldn't be any fun
if I just appeared in front of you.

00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:52.272
Try to find me.

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.819
But this park is massive.

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.322
Take a good look around.

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:05.660
You'll find me below the red balloon.

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.498
A red balloon?

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:17.547
A red balloon!

00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:19.549
I see it.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.093
Then I'll head that way.

00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:36.900
They're making this fun all on their own.

00:29:36.983 --> 00:29:38.151
It should make good TV.

00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:40.278
Hey, Do Ra-mi's a decent runner.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:46.951
Drone, keep tracking Ms. Cha Mu-hee.
Don't lose sight of her.

00:30:19.692 --> 00:30:22.654
Okay, next is a blue balloon.

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.155
Run!

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.037
A blue balloon this time.

00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:32.622
Again?

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.377
It's really hard to meet you.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.756
Just you wait. I will find you.

00:31:30.805 --> 00:31:31.639
Left.

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.100
To your left.

00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:02.462
Yes!

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:22.440
Found you!

00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:43.795
She found him!

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.714
Nice work, Do Ra-mi.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.217
- She's good!
- Do Ra-mi, nice!

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.135
- She's great.
- Of course she is!

00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:55.515
I guess we were worried for nothing.
They make an entertaining pair.

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:59.644
So this is considered entertaining?
Making someone run around all over town?

00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.437
It makes good TV.

00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:26.546
We've met before, haven't we?

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.173
I know your name now.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:32.051
Mr. Kurosawa Hiro, right?

00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:35.096
I remember you too.

00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:38.016
So we meet again, Ms. Cha Mu-hee.

00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:44.939
I might have ended up running around
until all your balloons were gone.

00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:51.112
I'm glad you found me
before they were all gone.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.073
I got these as a present for you.

00:34:13.968 --> 00:34:15.136
I'm sorry.

00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:17.346
I lost your present.

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.860
It's okay. I had fun thanks to you.

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:33.946
Thinking back to how you were
in that movie,

00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:36.783
I thought running around like crazy
to find a guy

00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:40.745
would suit you better
than sitting prettily waiting for him.

00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:44.540
And I was right.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:48.628
Wouldn't it be funny
if we cut from you running just now

00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:52.924
to the shot from your movie
of you running with a bloodied axe?

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:54.967
Right?

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.082
It was fun, like shooting a movie.

00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:37.176
It was fun for me too.

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:44.475
I had fun too.

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:49.689
Watching you frantically pedal that bike

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:51.524
was pretty hilarious.

00:35:57.613 --> 00:35:59.407
I also have a present for you.

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.382
Here's my present.

00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:18.843
It's a heart.

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.138
This is the worst.

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:55.880
What a pretty picture they make!
They look great.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:57.965
- Look.
- So pretty.

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:04.430
Canada is the country of maple leaves,

00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:08.309
so I thought I'd make you a heart
out of maple leaves.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.314
Here.

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.238
What's wrong?

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.739
There's dust in my eye.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.994
My contact fell out.

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:35.753
He says his eyesight is so bad
that he can't shoot without his contacts.

00:37:35.836 --> 00:37:37.380
And he didn't bring any spare.

00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:40.549
They can ship new ones from Japan,
but they'd arrive late tomorrow.

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.427
So we can't shoot anything
until his contacts arrive?

00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:46.973
What? But we were planning to go
to Horseshoe Canyon this afternoon,

00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:49.684
and today's the only day
we can film there.

00:37:50.393 --> 00:37:51.727
My apologies.

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:53.604
I'm sorry.

00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.274
Wait, Nanami…

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.734
Do something.

00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:03.990
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made that heart.

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:05.324
It's okay.

00:38:11.414 --> 00:38:13.499
How are we supposed to find it here?

00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:15.418
Even if we do, can he even wear it?

00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:17.461
Just look for something glossy.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:19.213
Careful.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.257
Glossy.

00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:23.092
Something glossy.

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:31.475
"This is the worst."

00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.937
I heard him say that.

00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:37.732
Though no one else understood.

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:44.363
If that's what you heard…

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:50.536
why didn't you interpret it
as you heard it?

00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:59.670
If I did, I'd ruin this project.

00:39:01.547 --> 00:39:04.759
If you can come up with a way
to resolve this matter quietly,

00:39:05.551 --> 00:39:06.969
I'll try to make it happen.

00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.517
There's one thing
Hiro is obsessed with right now.

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.978
That might help smooth things over.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.070
I mean, do I really need to go this far?

00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:34.955
Everyone seems to be blaming Mu-hee
for the shutdown,

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.041
saying she shouldn't have made that heart.

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:43.422
What, was there a freak windstorm?
How did his contact fall out?

00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:58.896
Are you going somewhere?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.402
To meet downtown, my friend.

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:13.869
His friend's name is Downtown?

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.377
Mr. Joo, I heard
you were going to "main town."

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.088
Can you give me a ride?

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:25.798
I have somewhere to go.

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:30.052
I don't believe I ever said yes…

00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:34.723
- Where are you going?
- A Japanese restaurant.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.144
A Japanese restaurant in Canada?

00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:40.646
I'm getting takeout for someone Japanese.

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:42.440
Let's go.

00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:46.026
I hear there's a really famous
Japanese place here.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.446
When you're away,
you tend to miss the food from home.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.574
He's only been away for two days.
I doubt he misses it quite yet.

00:40:52.074 --> 00:40:53.951
And we ate Japanese food on the flight.

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:58.164
I can't apologize empty-handed.

00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:03.294
Why go see him alone
when you can't even communicate?

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.338
Nanami, was it?
She speaks a little Korean.

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:09.592
I want to ask if he could shoot
while wearing glasses or something.

00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:11.719
It's up to the crew to persuade him.

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:13.220
Don't go see him.

00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:19.810
Why do you keep trying to stop me?
Do you think he won't want to see me?

00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:27.151
Earlier, Hiro said a whole lot,

00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:29.361
but you just gave me a brief sentence
and moved on.

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:31.697
What did he say?

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.410
I'm not sure. I can't remember
every single word I translated.

00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:40.873
I thought you had somewhere to be.

00:41:41.373 --> 00:41:44.335
Don't worry about me. Just go.
You said you were meeting a friend.

00:41:46.712 --> 00:41:50.633
I'll be right back. Wait here.
Don't go to see Hiro by yourself.

00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:05.439
Did Hiro say something rude
that he didn't translate?

00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:50.085
His eyes seem fine.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.548
That jerk lied to you.

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:55.674
What should we do?

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:07.227
Here.

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:14.360
Crack his skull.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.819
Throw it!

00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:38.092
You coward.

00:45:41.697 --> 00:45:42.740
He's gone.

00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:53.125
Just now…

00:45:55.335 --> 00:45:57.379
Do Ra-mi placed a rock in my hand.

00:45:58.714 --> 00:45:59.882
Told me to get mad.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:03.844
But…

00:46:06.346 --> 00:46:09.016
if I smacked him
in the back of the head now,

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.560
everything would be ruined.

00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.105
So I held back.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.441
Then you won.

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:23.489
You said you were rooting for me, right?
Then tell me everything.

00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:25.741
Why is he being like this?

00:46:28.702 --> 00:46:31.413
We've been having problems
since we set off from Japan.

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:36.126
He wasn't happy…
that you were cast alongside him.

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:39.379
I see.

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.301
So it was because he didn't like me.

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:52.893
Then, Mr. Joo, despite knowing
that he didn't like me,

00:46:53.852 --> 00:46:57.272
you listened to me
make a fool of myself yesterday.

00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:02.069
How stupid I must've looked to you
when I said

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:05.572
we were going to act
all cutesy and lovey-dovey?

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:10.828
You don't have to hold back.
Go ahead and get mad.

00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:21.964
You should've talked me out
of making that stupid heart.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.031
It really was that zombie.

00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:51.451
Why did she just walk away?

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.371
She definitely saw me.

00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:58.584
The interpreter is here to see you.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:00.919
The interpreter? Why?

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:07.009
I bet the production crew sent you
to convince me to resume the shoot.

00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:10.637
Your eyesight must be quite poor.

00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:13.307
Those glasses look very thick.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.439
It's an insecurity of mine.

00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:23.859
I don't even leave my house
without my contacts.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.737
So I can't continue the shoot.

00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:28.697
I see.

00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:30.949
Well, that's a shame.

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:34.453
Hiro.

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:37.289
I suggest you check again thoroughly

00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:40.042
to see if you really didn't bring
any spare contacts.

00:48:41.793 --> 00:48:43.003
Otherwise,

00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:45.631
you may really regret it.

00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:01.229
Hiro can resume the shoot.

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:03.106
Thank goodness.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.859
I guess Mr. Joo was able to persuade him.

00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:12.074
Fortunately, he managed to find
some spare contacts.

00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:14.785
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Not at all.

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:17.329
- I'm so glad. Let's go.
- Yes, let's.

00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:21.959
Before the shoot,
he would like to talk to the crew.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.627
Both of you,

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.963
please come upstairs.

00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:25.373
Why did you turn your phone off?

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.626
Were you looking for me?

00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:29.669
Why? Want me to hit you again?

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.923
Today's shoot is back on.

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:35.842
We need to hurry. Let's go.

00:51:44.684 --> 00:51:47.187
Was Hiro embarrassed that I caught him?

00:51:48.313 --> 00:51:51.191
Maybe he decided to act first
before I reported him to the crew?

00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:54.194
Why the change of heart?

00:51:56.029 --> 00:51:56.863
I'm not sure.

00:51:58.698 --> 00:52:01.243
In any case,
I'm relieved we can resume the shoot.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.914
What are you gonna do? Can you keep
holding yourself back and playing dumb?

00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:10.794
I'm great at playing dumb
in front of someone who doesn't like me.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.713
If I didn't, I would've been kicked out.

00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:17.717
You heard at the doctor's office.

00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:22.389
I wasn't welcome at my relatives' home,
so I learned to catch on quickly.

00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:29.813
What is it?

00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:34.151
I've been pushed around enough,
so I can handle it. Don't worry.

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.112
Do Ra-mi gave you a rock, right?

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.699
You might not be able to throw it,

00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:44.119
but can't you at least tell him
that you've got a rock in your hand?

00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:46.371
That way, he won't push you around.

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:52.836
If you want to tell him, go ahead.
I'll make sure he gets the message.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:54.880
You will?

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:59.384
Even if I swear?
You said you don't translate profanity.

00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:02.012
Curse him out if you want.
I'll translate it this time.

00:53:05.473 --> 00:53:08.894
You left out some of what Hiro said
on purpose, didn't you?

00:53:09.978 --> 00:53:12.355
You were worried I'd get mad
and ruin the shoot.

00:53:14.941 --> 00:53:17.861
So you do feel bad for conspiring
with Producer Kim to trick me.

00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:20.447
That's not why.

00:53:23.658 --> 00:53:25.160
I didn't feel like interpreting.

00:53:26.953 --> 00:53:29.581
It upset me for some reason.

00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.883
I thought that no matter what anyone said,

00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:42.761
you interpreted
without any emotion whatsoever.

00:53:43.845 --> 00:53:46.848
Good point. I guess I got upset
because I'm on your side.

00:53:51.978 --> 00:53:52.812
I'm sorry.

00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:01.571
Well, since you're on my side,

00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.241
I'll let it slide.

00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:05.218
Go on ahead and get ready.

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.469
I'll see you, then.

00:55:10.181 --> 00:55:11.391
Mr. Joo Ho-jin.

00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:14.060
Thank you.

00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:06.112
Sorry for the delay.

00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:09.157
- Welcome back.
- I'm sorry.

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:15.789
Sorry for the wait. Hello.

00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:32.847
This place is huge.

00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:36.184
How many Tokyo Domes would fit in here?

00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:52.951
The clock tower?

00:57:29.696 --> 00:57:30.780
It's a heart.

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:34.117
You ruined the last one,
so take good care of this one.

00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:53.178
All right, let's begin the shoot
at Horseshoe Canyon.

00:58:26.294 --> 00:58:27.337
Not even a "thank you"?

00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:39.557
Wow.

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:01.704
Thankfully, I think we'll be done
before the sun sets.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:07.544
But why is Mu-hee in such a good mood?

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.222
I didn't feel like interpreting.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:36.364
How'd he manage to persuade Hiro, anyway?

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.917
I've been to Canada before.

00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:50.003
Vancouver, Calgary, and Banff.

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:54.799
He's obsessed
with going to live sporting events.

00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:59.554
He's come to Canada a few times before,

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:03.808
but he's always regretted
never getting to see an ice hockey game.

01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:09.689
Ice hockey…

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.372
I'm guessing you'd need your contacts
to watch the ice hockey game.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:40.261
Yong-u, did you not pack any snacks?
You said you had dried pollack chips.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.431
I swear I brought so many bags of snacks.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:47.226
But why… is this the only thing left?

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:49.145
Who ate the rest?

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.432
You seem a lot better
after getting those tickets.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.434
To be honest,

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.146
when he told you to talk with the crew
instead of taking it out on Cha Mu-hee,

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.607
I was certain you'd get mad.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:40.238
I was waiting for a chance to score
when Mr. Joo gave me the perfect assist.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.116
It wasn't just because of the ticket.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:46.327
Thanks to him,
the crew agreed to accept my input.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:51.082
This is a reality television show.

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:55.837
We don't want you to force a smile
all the time like a prince either.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.632
Tell us when you're in a bad mood
or if you're not up to something.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.801
We want you to be honest.

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:06.389
Then what if I never warm up
to Ms. Cha Mu-hee

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:08.808
and decide I don't want
to keep traveling with her?

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.393
Would that be okay?

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.522
Yes.

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:18.735
Then you two can split up
and travel solo, I guess.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.196
But what if the opposite happens?

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:26.951
What will you do if you grow fond of her?

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.370
Can you be honest then too?

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.874
That's ridiculous.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.836
If I grow to like Cha Mu-hee…

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.674
I won't hide it.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.634
I'll confess my feelings.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:51.976
This isn't a joke. I mean it.

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:54.812
So please translate my words verbatim.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:07.158
I didn't feel like interpreting.

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:10.953
It upset me for some reason.

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:34.310
The heart of a zombie…

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:38.940
Have I been infected?

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.957
CAN THIS LOVE BE TRANSLATED?

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:03.310
