=Episode 12=

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.846
What are you doing?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.378
Hey.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.647
Weren't you injured?

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.263
You haven't broken a limb.

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:41.920
Not your concern.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.955
Mengmeng, are you okay?

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:45.763
Not your concern.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.570
Wen Shanna.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.878
What were you doing just now?

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:52.801
Why do you care what I'm doing?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.246
Guan Mengmeng.

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.861
If you curse me again,

00:00:58.015 --> 00:00:59.131
I swear,

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:00.207
next time,

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:02.284
something will definitely happen to you.

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:04.131
Come on, I'm not afraid!

00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:06.400
Wen Shanna!

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:07.823
Let go of me.

00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:08.977
Let go of me!

00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:09.669
Mengmeng. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.960
Lin Ge, keep your Princess under control.

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.207
Keep yours under control.

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.823
Mengmeng.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:18.707
Wait for me.

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.092
Liar. Get lost.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.131
Mengmeng.

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:27.515
These two

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:28.438
are unbelievable.

00:01:28.938 --> 00:01:29.400
Did you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.284
get hurt?

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:31.592
Move away!

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.785
I really didn't mean to lie to you.

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:41.554
If you can forgive me,

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:41.977
I…

00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:43.323
I'll do anything.

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:45.362
Really?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.016
Yeah.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:48.593
Anything?

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.708
(You got a deal, Song Pai.)

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.899
Hi everyone!

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.168
I'm your palace girl,
Xiaodoli Mengmeng.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.514
Welcome to my livestream.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.514
We've got a very special guest today.

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:12.322
Let's give him a warm welcome.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.514
He might be a little shy,

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:24.399
so give us a second.

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:30.976
This guest right here

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:34.091
is the dream guy of nine hundred
million girls in Manbo Kingdom.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.630
Our First Prince of Manbo Kingdom,
Prince Song Pai.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.860
Let's welcome him!

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:42.130
Say hi.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.130
Say hi?

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:46.783
Do you still want me to forgive you?

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:49.630
Hi everyone, I'm Song Pai.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.940
(First Prince is so handsome.)

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.420
(The host is so pretty.)

00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:56.553
Looks like Prince Song Pai is
still insanely popular.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:58.000
Alright, no more talking,

00:02:58.014 --> 00:02:59.937
let's introduce our first product.

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:01.760
It's the scent

00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:04.476
of the prince.

00:03:05.737 --> 00:03:07.930
"Let's have the First Prince try it."

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.160
Okay, babes, no problem.

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:11.468
Let's try it.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.891
- Try it?
- Try it.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.980
(I really like this host.)

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.460
(Love it.)

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.430
(Drop the link!)

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.160
Describe how it smells.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.391
No problem, babes.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.980
(This pairing is so good.)

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.340
(They're totally flirting.)

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.900
(I really like the First Prince.)

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:36.160
It has this

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:39.237
light, subtle wine note,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.431
and a warm, woody scent
that feels really comforting.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.162
It smells amazing, babes.

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:52.085
Oh?

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:54.354
Your babes are saying

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:57.162
they want to smell
the First Princess's scent too.

00:03:58.508 --> 00:03:59.431
Sure.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.740
(This is so ship-worthy.)

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.140
(Kiss, kiss!)

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.460
(We can't wait anymore!)

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.780
(First Prince, you got this. Kiss her!)

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.580
(Hurry up and kiss!)

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:24.839
What are you doing?

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:25.915
We're live.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.108
They're asking for a kiss.

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:27.900
(Kiss, kiss!)

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.940
(Hurry up!)

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:32.954
It's selling like crazy.

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:39.800
As expected of Song Pai. You nailed it.

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:46.839
(Song Pai...)

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.146
(He really is charming.)

00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:50.031
(I almost lost it just now.)

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.415
(Wait, did I already lose it?)

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:54.531
(But I'm just a contracted princess.)

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.381
Your Majesty.

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:03.034
These past few days,

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:04.842
although the royal family

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:07.342
has done everything to raise funds,

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:08.496
the situation

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:11.881
in the southern disaster zone
is simply too severe.

00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:13.496
The money we've raised

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.265
is nowhere near enough.

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:17.573
Recently,

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:19.188
the southern areas

00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:20.765
have faced serious shortages

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:22.265
of supplies and funds.

00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:23.919
The two princes'

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.111
fundraising deadline is almost here.

00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:29.073
How are your preparations coming along?

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.496
Father,

00:05:32.688 --> 00:05:33.842
Mengmeng and I have

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.842
raised funds through
cross-border e-commerce

00:05:35.842 --> 00:05:37.090
and foreign trade partnerships.

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.150
We've raised two hundred million.

00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:44.265
This amount can already be
put into disaster reconstruction.

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:46.650
Two hundred million?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.611
That's impressive.

00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:48.540
It really is.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:52.611
Only two hundred million.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.534
Hmph.

00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:56.419
Father,

00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.150
Wen Shanna and I have
also raised tens of millions

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.573
through real-sector investments.

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.534
And moving forward,

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:04.050
there'll be even more funds coming in.

00:06:04.727 --> 00:06:05.265
Good.

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:06.304
Very good.

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:09.881
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.534
Your Majesty,

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:21.073
the First Prince being
able to raise funds so quickly

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.304
is certainly something to celebrate.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.688
However, in my view,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.227
the First Prince and the First Princess

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:32.842
appearing so frequently
in public livestreams

00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:35.958
is really

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.573
beneath the dignity of the royal family.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:38.342
Right?

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:41.073
(That old fox.)

00:06:41.265 --> 00:06:43.073
(Making trouble
when the country's in crisis.)

00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:46.573
Your Majesty,

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.034
I've also paid some attention
to the Firstn Prince's

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.304
and First Princess's livestreams.

00:06:51.804 --> 00:06:54.342
I actually find them quite refreshing.

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.650
These are screenshots
I saved on my phone.

00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.150
Take a look.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.397
Aren't they rather interesting?

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:14.281
Oh my.

00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:16.127
This is...

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.948
This is outrageous!

00:07:22.756 --> 00:07:23.986
Your Majesty,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.871
we didn't steal,
and we didn't rob anyone.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.930
We even managed
to raise money for disaster relief.

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:31.486
So how is that improper?

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:33.948
That said,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.256
since Mr. Saul believes

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.563
that livestreaming with the First Prince
damages the royal image,

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:40.833
why not

00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:43.140
have Mr. Saul try livestreaming himself?

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.602
Why you little...

00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:51.102
You're pretty witty.

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:53.833
Then let's do it

00:07:55.486 --> 00:07:57.486
the way the First Princess suggested.

00:07:59.025 --> 00:07:59.563
Your Majesty…

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.833
I don't know how to do livestreams.

00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:16.448
Mr. Saul livestreaming?

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.563
Would anyone even send him gifts?

00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:21.333
I'll register an account tomorrow.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.525
I'll send him gifts myself.

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:24.833
I'll even make a burner account.

00:08:26.602 --> 00:08:28.717
I really want to see
what he's actually like.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.217
What are you looking at?

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:32.486
Your necklace.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.448
I wear it every day, don't I?

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:37.179
When you wear it,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.025
have you ever seen

00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:40.333
anything strange?

00:08:40.794 --> 00:08:42.294
Something strange?

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.794
You mean

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.448
that person from three hundred years ago
who looked like me?

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:48.630
How much do you know about it?

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.563
I checked the archives.

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:54.717
It was basically a tragic couple,

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:58.140
and they left behind a sad legend.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.833
What do you think
our relationship to them is?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.371
Come on.

00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:05.700
What relationship could there be?

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.256
Even if I look exactly like
someone from three hundred years ago,

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.217
I'm still me.

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:16.333
The one and only Guan Mengmeng.

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:21.025
Why are you always so fearless?

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.679
With you by my side,

00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.217
I always feel like

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.063
there's nothing we can't handle.

00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:35.179
There's no enemy I can't defeat.

00:09:35.602 --> 00:09:37.333
You're exaggerating.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.085
My Princess is the best in the world.

00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:44.431
(Song Pai,
at least you've got good taste.)

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.700
Fundraising can't wait.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.315
I'll go pick products first.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.892
(Guan Mengmeng, oh Guan Mengmeng…)

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.431
(He's a real prince.)

00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:56.123
(You're just a small e-commerce seller.)

00:09:56.123 --> 00:09:57.508
(Don't get ideas.)

00:09:57.508 --> 00:09:58.931
(Get a grip.)

00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:06.315
Curse that Guan Mengmeng.

00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:07.931
Making me do a livestream

00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:09.854
just to embarrass myself.

00:10:09.854 --> 00:10:11.130
I don't even know how to do this.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.277
What am I even selling?

00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:13.161
Huh?

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:15.238
Coffee?

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:17.315
What is this?

00:10:22.046 --> 00:10:23.623
That's perfume.

00:10:26.238 --> 00:10:27.508
Can this even sell?

00:10:29.777 --> 00:10:30.277
Um…

00:10:31.392 --> 00:10:32.354
We're starting now.

00:10:38.623 --> 00:10:39.315
Babes.

00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:43.161
I've already negotiated
the price down for you.

00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:45.008
Three…

00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:45.777
Two…

00:10:45.777 --> 00:10:46.700
One…

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.200
Go!

00:10:48.777 --> 00:10:49.700
Go!

00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:52.738
What nonsense is this?

00:10:52.738 --> 00:10:53.892
Go where?

00:10:53.892 --> 00:10:54.700
What go?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.700
(Host, can you try it?)

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.046
(Can you describe how it smells?)

00:10:57.046 --> 00:10:58.700
(Does this coffee taste good?)

00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:01.623
If it's good or not,
just buy it and find out.

00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:03.085
There are a few flavours anyway.

00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:04.590
Buy it and drink it, then you'll know.

00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:05.931
Obvious, isn't it?

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:08.315
(Why aren't you smiling?)

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.008
What's there to smile about?

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:12.354
I feel like crying already.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.431
And you want me to smile?

00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:14.431
(Is he always this fierce?)

00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:15.469
(The host is so cold.)

00:11:15.469 --> 00:11:16.931
(Bro, you're way too scary.)

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:18.777
(So icy I'm gonna die.)

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:19.777
Die?

00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:20.969
Who's killing you?

00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.892
I wouldn't dare.

00:11:22.892 --> 00:11:24.277
That'd be illegal.

00:11:24.277 --> 00:11:27.085
I'm doing a livestream here,
I can't have anyone dying.

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.085
No killing.

00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:29.931
Just buy stuff.

00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:30.854
No killing, okay?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.140
(Follow the stream, everyone.)

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.500
(This host is hilarious.)

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.740
(Hahahahaha.)

00:11:39.161 --> 00:11:40.892
What is this thing doing to me?

00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:41.854
Why do I look like this?

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:43.469
What kind of mess is this?

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:44.623
This is...

00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.238
This is outrageous.

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.200
I'm done streaming.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.777
Bro, can you add more stock?

00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:51.123
I didn't get any.

00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.220
(Bro, I missed it.)

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.020
(Host, add more, I didn't get it.)

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:54.408
Add more stock?

00:11:54.408 --> 00:11:55.215
How?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.985
The stock...

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:57.523
It's sold out, so add more.

00:11:57.523 --> 00:11:58.907
Sold out already?

00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:00.562
That's insane.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.746
Oh wow.

00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:04.284
I just said a few words and it's gone?

00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:07.784
Guess livestreaming really does work.

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:10.400
Alright, I'll add more.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.438
Adding more stock.

00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:13.823
But how do I do that?

00:12:13.823 --> 00:12:14.476
Adding more…

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.910
Where did everyone go?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.770
(The king praised Song Pai's
emerging economic model,)

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.300
(and the e-commerce boom is surging.)

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.253
The news about
His Majesty praising Song Pai

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.830
has already spread everywhere.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.407
All the investments
we talked about earlier

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.484
have pulled out.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.407
So how much did we lose?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.157
We're already in debt.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:55.811
It's okay.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.657
I'll find a way
to convince other investors.

00:13:01.003 --> 00:13:01.695
Don't worry.

00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:05.157
I'm sorry.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.246
Don't apologise.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.592
You've done your best.

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:08.746
If anything,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.361
I barely did anything useful.

00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:13.361
I should be apologizing.

00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:18.861
Have some water.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.380
(No one has ever been this good to me.)
