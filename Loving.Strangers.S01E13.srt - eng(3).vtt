The subject's guardian

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.930
has already admitted.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.050
For the sake of progress,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.380
they hid

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.930
the subject's drug allergy history.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.540
The subject's symptoms at the time also matched

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770
[Main Conference Room]
the allergic symptoms of Alteplase.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.740
R&D Department,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.490
any further questions?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.900
I have no issues here.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.490
But reports involving adverse reactions

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.660
still need final confirmation

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.770
from PV.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.850
It's already been verified.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.850
After receiving an intravenous injection

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.940
of 8mg Alteplase,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.060
followed by a 50-minute infusion,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.260
the subject experienced a severe allergic reaction.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.570
All right.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.170
Since there are no objections,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.730
we can officially submit

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.260
the marketing application for SA-0988.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.220
I'm not finished yet.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.290
The subject

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.980
did use Alteplase that day,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.500
and did experience an allergic reaction.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.940
But this was the first time he used this drug.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.130
So the claim of hiding the allergy history

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.690
doesn't hold up.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.730
Someone

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.170
tried to use this statement

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.980
to revoke the subject's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.850
trial qualification.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.340
This was meant to invalidate his trial data,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.340
thus making everyone overlook

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.290
a more serious issue.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.540
That is, SA-0988

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.610
may be linked

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.730
to the subject's sudden cerebral infarction.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.980
The subject

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.660
had no history of cerebral infarction.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.100
But four hours

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.980
after using SA-0988,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.290
he suffered a cerebral infarction.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.220
This case,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.170
according to the regulations,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.130
must be classified

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.730
as a SUSAR

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.170
and reported.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.610
So,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.340
to invalidate this case

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.940
as a SUSAR,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.060
the only way

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.100
is to revoke the subject's qualification.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.220
Jiang Jiaqi, what do you mean?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.100
Are you questioning

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.730
the authenticity of this statement?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.130
When our company received this statement,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.010
it's my responsibility

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.980
to take it seriously.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.380
Who knows

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.610
why he had to write this statement?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.290
Do you want me to spell it out for you?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.170
Director Jiang,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.940
I'm very clear in my mind

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.380
how much effort

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.780
everyone at the company

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.780
has put into SA-0988.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.170
So I want to ask everyone,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.730
who doesn't know how important safety is?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.340
But medical development

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.540
and the advancement of drugs

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.610
have always come

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.380
with risks.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.660
So many Alzheimer's patients

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.940
in our country

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.290
are waiting for medication.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.500
Their condition

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.410
continues to worsen day by day.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.170
The earlier it's approved,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.010
the sooner

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.850
we can help them

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.060
delay the progression of their disease,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.980
and alleviate their suffering.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.890
We have such a large trial base.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.220
Why should we focus

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.730
on such a small probability

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.540
of adverse reaction?

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.100
I believe we can

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.980
push SA-0988 to market quickly,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.340
and then continue to optimize it.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.980
Director Jiang,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.370
if this is because

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.540
of your personal emotions,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.020
I must remind you,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.170
don't let them affect your work.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.250
Do you know

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.340
what the subject told me?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.170
If it's his fault

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.220
that this drug won't make it to market,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.810
he'll feel guilty.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.580
In our family,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.730
we have two patients.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.340
I know

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.700
what it's like to wait

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.930
for life-saving medicine.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.290
Mr. Wang,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.340
did someone tell you something?

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.410
Did he tell you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.580
if your father hides his drug allergy history,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.980
he is likely

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.290
to be dropped from the trial?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.220
What?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.900
That's not what he said.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.020
What's his name?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.660
I...

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.020
I honestly don't remember.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.340
He only said

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.220
he's from Sen'an Pharma.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.100
He promised my dad could continue the trial.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.980
That's why I agreed to say that.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.810
So who should feel guilty?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.850
We saw the risks,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.050
yet plan to ignore them.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.580
Shouldn't we feel ashamed?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.810
There are over 10 million Alzheimer's patients

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.100
in our country.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.810
Even if the serious adverse reaction rate

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.810
is only 1%,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.170
that's still 100,000 people.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.660
Why are we making drugs?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.410
Is it for profit?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.050
Or to save people?

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.930
Isn't the original intention

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.780
of making drugs

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.700
to ensure everyone's health

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.490
and safety?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.980
You say I have personal emotions,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.780
I admit it.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.700
Because I'm in PV.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.580
It's my duty,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.170
and my conscience.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.810
Therefore, I advocate

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.660
for extending

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.050
the phase Ⅲ trial of SA-0988

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.780
to further test its safety.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.540
And this case of SUSAR

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.540
must be reported to the authorities!

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.580
Today, our PV Dept

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.780

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.700
Boss, you really nailed it.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.660
My heart was racing.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.700
It was pounding so fast.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.490
Boss,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.140
for the first time,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.900
I feel so proud

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.780
to work in PV.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.900
Boss,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.490
no matter what,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.730
give me a chance today.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.810
Let me sincerely apologize to you.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.980
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.580
Oh, I'll buy you a drink!

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.370
Let's go somewhere fancy.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.490
Of course!

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.050
I know a place that's really expensive.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.850
Expensive and delicious!

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.410
Sounds good.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.220
Come on, tell me about it.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.290
Alright.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.810
Hey, Mom.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.050
Are you busy?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.140
Can you come home for dinner today?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.700
I made Crispy Ribbonfish.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.610
Ask Yijun to join us for dinner.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.290
I haven't seen her in a while.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.930
She's been busy recently.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.290
I'll be back soon.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.100
[Yijun]

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.100
Are you free tonight?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.900
Mom wants us to come home for dinner.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.290
I still have work to finish.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.290
Can't you just do it at home?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.980
Mom said she hasn't seen you in a long time.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.900
How about you go by yourself?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.290
I'll definitely go next week.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.810
I'll check my schedule

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.580
and let you know which day, okay?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.540
No need. Go on with your work.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.180
Mr. Gu.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.340
Mr. Gao.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.370
Mr. Gu,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.730
do you have any plans for the evening?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.490
Mr. Han would like to invite you to dinner.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.730
There's a new restaurant.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.340
He just sent me the location.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.340
I have an appointment.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.700
Alright.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.490
I'll turn him down.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.420
Next time.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.340
Okay.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.010
I want to play you

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.940
a nice song.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.700
Why won't this Bluetooth speaker

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.700
connect to my phone?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.530
Is it broken?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.940
I'll help you with it in a minute.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.850
He's getting pretty close with the old man.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.730
What?

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.180
Why do I feel

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.490
like he's not leaving Sen'an?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.730
What happened?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.770
Our chairman

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.940
suddenly came to the company yesterday.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.490
He didn't greet anyone.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.060
Guess what?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.610
He came specially to invite him to play a round of golf.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.060
He and our chairman

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.940
have been in contact privately.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.490
He never mentioned it to you?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.610
Don't you talk

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.580
at home at all?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.820
Maybe the Chairman

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.980
isn't that important to him?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.820
But he's important to me.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.490
The Chairman goes out

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.770
with you every week.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.300
But he only invited him once.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.940
Are you so nervous about it?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.700
Do you think he'll leave Sen'an?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.820
Whether it's changing jobs or starting a business,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.420
it all takes time.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.300
Besides,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.490
you know his character.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.060
He won't make decisions so easily.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.770
Don't worry about it.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.220
Let's eat.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.300
Let's eat.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.940
Jiaqi!

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.490
Mom!

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.580
You forgot to take this!

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.580
Crispy Ribbonfish.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.650
Why deliver them?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.700
I can have them next time.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.530
They're for Yijun.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.530
Don't refrigerate them. Eat them fresh.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.940
I have water boiling on the stove.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.850
I need to head back.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.220
Take care!

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.650
Let's down another bottle...

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.700
One more bottle...

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.700
Not too much...

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.100
Watch where you're going!

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.490
Are you blind?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.890
Paying attention...

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:05.850
Come here!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.940
He's just an old guy. Stop...

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.650
Come here!

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.420
Get lost already!

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.180
Let's go. Watch out...

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.730
Is everything okay with Mom?

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.340
She made Crispy Ribbonfish for you.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.250
Eat them for me.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.010
They're your favorite.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.940
The information

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.100
on the biopharmaceutical company,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.850
I found it for you.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.650
I'll place it here.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.490
Well,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.100
Jiangbei High-tech Park

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.130
is currently recruiting.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.370
I contacted their operations director.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.770
They're really interested

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.700
in clinical pharmaceutical

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.940
trial service companies.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.890
If it's from Sen'an,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.060
we can talk about...

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.490
we can talk about the first year

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.010
with tax exemptions and rent-free terms.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.530
They also helped apply

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.820
for high-tech enterprise qualifications.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:56.540

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:06.740

♪Sometimes I go with it, spinning like a top...♪

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.580
I found

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.530
a nice spot at Baihua Mountain.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.420
I plan

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.820
to bring firewood and a tent there

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.530
this weekend.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.490
Let's go camping there.

I made you some dried tangerine peel tea.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.180
The doctor said,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.770
you shouldn't drink strong tea.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.570
This one is light.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.090
Please.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.180
When people get older,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.940
they're always being taken care of.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.570
It's really uncomfortable.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.700
What about this?

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.010
I'll roast some lamb kidneys for you at noon.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.980
Good!

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.860
Good?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.700
You just can't stop eating.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.010
Why didn't you

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.090
bring more people with you?

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.940
You're still a CEO after all.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.730
Look at you,

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.090
running around doing everything,

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.900
you know.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.420
Out here in the wild,

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.490
you gotta do things yourself.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.330
That's where the real fun is.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.420
I'm very similar to you in this respect.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.980
Besides,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.900
I really enjoy hearing your stories

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.770
from your time in the countryside.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.140
I always learn so much.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.490
Alright.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.660
I know you're just trying to make me happy.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.250
Today's young people

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.570
are not interested

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.010
in this at all.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.250
That's because they've never heard of it.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.330
I actually can't wait for it.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.140
Add some firewood.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.490
When I was little in the village,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.090
after harvesting the rapeseed,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.570
we would burn the straw.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.420
The whole field

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.730
would crackle with fire and smoke.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.220
It was beautiful!

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.570
Let me tell you...

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.940
You're here too?

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.380
Chairman.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.140
Mr. Gu asked me to come.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.620
Why didn't you tell me?

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.730
Chairman,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.490
weren't you always trying to invite Director Jiang out?

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.140
Here he is.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.050
Alright.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.010
Sounds good!

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.900
Grab a chair for yourself.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.860
Okay.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.220
That's great.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.700
Director Jiang, I didn't expect you

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.530
to be so knowledgeable about the outdoors.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.420
I haven't heard the sound of burning firewood in a long time.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.140
Looks like we've finally found

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.050
something we can both enjoy doing together.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.290
You two were in the same major

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.900
back in college?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.010
Yeah.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.700
Same major.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.530
We both studied pharmaceutical chemistry.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.250
My senior was a grad student,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.010
and I was an undergrad.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.700
Before graduation,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.010
I was lucky to join his project

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.860
and help.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.290
As an undergrad,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.730
you got into a graduate project group?

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.620
I owe it to his recommendation.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.570
My senior's advisor

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.330
is a top figure in the research world.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.380
All of their projects are national-level.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.860
It really helped me with my application to go abroad.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.050
Here, Jiaqi.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.490
Your coffee.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.810
So you two aren't from the same year?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.490
How did you meet?

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.010
The choir.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.220
The choir?

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.180
You

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.380
actually joined the choir?

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.770
It must have been

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.140
to chase after a girl, right?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.420
Flip it over.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.420
It's almost burnt.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.180
Look at you.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.730
Where's the salt?

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.490
It's in the back tent.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.380
[What's going on? Why is he here?]

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.180
What are you doing?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.180
[What's going on? Why is he here?]

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.940
If you dare contact her,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.530
you're done for.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.290
Chairman, please stay seated.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.090
We'll take care of it.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.810
It's fine.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.380
Let's do it together.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.940
Chairman,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.420
your car's here.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.700
Why don't you go back first?

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.420
No need.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.980
We'll finish up

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.730
and leave together.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.330
Hurry up.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.860
What do you want, exactly?

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.900
You came here today

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.530
just to show off

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.380
in front of the Chairman?

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.180
Does it help you for the Chairman

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.810
to know that?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.620
From the first time

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.570
I saw you in school,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.770
I felt uncomfortable all over.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.180
The way you were full of ambition

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.180
because of your self-doubt

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.570
just made me feel uneasy.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.900
I know what kind of person you are.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.730
To climb higher,

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.490
you'll stop at nothing,

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.220
no morals whatsoever.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.490
But I didn't expect

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.730
you'd do something

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.530
so disgusting!

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.090
Frame me, get rid of me,

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.700
and then what?

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.940
Have her divorce me,

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.010
and you'll marry her?

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.220
No way.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.140
How could someone like you marry a woman

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.180
who has no money, no background,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.570
is divorced,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.380
and has a kid?

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.420
Go ahead.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.290
What do you want to do?

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.570
I have just one question.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.420
Does she know

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.700
that you framed me

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.940
and tried to get rid of me?

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.980
Does she know, exactly?

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.330
This has nothing to do with her.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.980
I can guarantee that.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.330
My original intention was never like this.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.220
There were some unexpected events.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.660
She's afraid you'll be wronged at the company.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.660
She hopes you can leave

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.860
with some dignity.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.010
Jiang Jiaqi,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.770
as long as you resign voluntarily,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.180
I guarantee you the best conditions.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.700
I'll personally write you a recommendation letter.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.570
I'll make sure you leave

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.050
with enough dignity.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.700
Dignity?

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.290
Hurry and go to the hospital.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.490
Take care.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.770
Break up with her soon.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.090
I don't care what reason you use.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.730
Just do it as soon as possible.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.490
And,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.050
she cannot know

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.010
what I know.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.730
It's impossible

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.290
to hide it now.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.530
It must be hidden.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.090
As long as you two break up quietly,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.290
I can overlook the past.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.530
But no matter what,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.660
she can't know.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.140
This is the only condition on which I'll forgive you.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.570
Don't even think about secretly telling her,

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.180
or making her act in front of me.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:22.770
After living together for so many years,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.940
she won't be able to fool me.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.700
Just do as I say.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.940
If you try any tricks again,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.730
it's over for you.

[Emergency Department]

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.530
Look at the time.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.420
Weren't we supposed to get up early?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.900
Why are we working late again?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.220
What time can we drink tonight?

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.090
There's almost nothing left.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:26.900
Seriously,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.940
anyone else can do this little task.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.900
Why does Chi have to ask us?

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.140
He's got a few shares in us,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.330
and that makes him special?

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.330
Just bossing us around.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.530
Yeah, we owe him.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.530
We're at his mercy.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:35.980
We drive his car.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.940
We owe him a lot.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.330
You scared me to death!

Youyou,

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.530
what are you doing here?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.220
It's so late,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.220
and it's cold out here.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.290
Come on, let's get inside.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.010
Jiang Jialu, where are you going?

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.090
Why are you just leaving

without a word?

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.380
Youyou,

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.490
don't mind that.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.490
Get inside now.

Only instant coffee left.

Or just warm your hands on it.

Well...

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.330
that day, I was wrong.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.810
I said it too harshly.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.940
You were just unlucky

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.090
to end up in my crew.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.660
So you're saying

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.420
my acting isn't that bad?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.900
It's actually

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.570
your agent's fault.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.140
Why not be a good idol

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.570
instead of acting in my crew?

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.490
You're not even getting paid much.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.010
I forced my agent to make the deal.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.420
Then it's your fault.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.010
Right.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.770
It's my fault

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.090
I fell for a fool like you.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.420
With that EQ,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.220
you're probably hopeless.
